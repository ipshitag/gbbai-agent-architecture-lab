    "\n",
    "AutoGen introduces conversable agents designed for task-solving through inter-agent dialogue. Key features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conversable**: Agents can initiate and continue conversations with others.\n",
    "- **Customizable**: Integration of LLMs, humans, tools, or combinations thereof is supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen includes a `ConversableAgent` class for agents that communicate to complete tasks. Agents vary in their actions upon receiving messages. Notably:\n",
    "- `AssistantAgent` acts as an AI assistant, primarily using LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) to generate Python code for tasks described in messages. It can suggest corrections post-execution. Customization is possible via system messages and LLM configuration (`llm_config`).\n",
    "- `UserProxyAgent` represents human users, defaulting to soliciting human input but capable of executing code and using tools. It can automatically execute code blocks from messages if no human input is provided, with the option to disable this feature. LLM-based responses can be enabled with `llm_config`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents' auto-reply feature promotes autonomous communication while allowing for human input. Extension is straightforward with the `register_reply()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup includes creating an `AssistantAgent` named \"assistant\" and a `UserProxyAgent` named \"user_proxy\" to facilitate task-solving."

    "### Initial Configuration with `config_list`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `config_list` plays a crucial role in tailoring our setup to accommodate various tasks, each potentially requiring a distinct model. This flexibility is particularly important as we plan to leverage GPT-4 for our operations. The `config_list` is essentially a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary specifying configurations for different endpoints. These configurations are pivotal for ensuring that the correct model and endpoint are utilized for the intended task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Advantages of Multi-Agent Architectures with GPT-4o:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Latency Capabilities:** GPT-4o's superior response times are crucial for environments where agents must interact swiftly, ensuring fluid and efficient communication.\n",
    "- **Cost Efficiency:** Its cost-effective deployment supports extensive agent interactions, maintaining budgetary control while maximizing operational scale.\n",
    "- **Optimized Performance:** The model's cutting-edge technology boosts overall system performance, especially in complex, multi-agent environments where precision and reliability are paramount.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Reflection**\n",
    "  - Reflection allows an agent to evaluate its own actions and outcomes, facilitating continuous improvement. By analyzing past decisions, the agent can identify errors and refine its strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tool Utilization**\n",
    "  - This pattern involves agents leveraging external tools or APIs to augment their capabilities. By accessing specialized resources, agents can perform tasks beyond their inherent functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Planning**\n",
    "  - Planning involves an agent's ability to devise a structured sequence of actions to achieve a specific goal. This includes breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps and organizing them logically.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mixture of Experts and Composable Collaboration**\n",
    "  - This approach involves multiple specialized agents, or \"experts,\" working together to accomplish tasks that may be too complex for a single agent or a simple multi-agent architecture."

    "\n",
    "### Pattern 1: Two-Agent Chat Conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine two specialized agents having a conversation to improve a medical manuscript. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Starting the Chat**: The Medical Researcher agent sends the first message. This message is the initial draft of the manuscript based on the provided research findings. The message includes instructions to ensure the content is scientifically accurate, comprehensive, and informative. It should cover all necessary details of the study, including methodology, results, and conclusions. The draft should be clear and precise, suitable for peer review and publication.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exchanging Messages**: The Clinical Evaluator agent receives the draft and replies with feedback. The Clinical Evaluator's task is to review the manuscript thoroughly, ensuring it is clinically accurate, relevant, and adheres to ethical guidelines. The evaluator provides detailed and constructive feedback to enhance the scientific rigor and ethical considerations of the document. The Medical Researcher then revises the manuscript based on this feedback, and they continue to exchange messages, refining the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ending the Chat**: After they've exchanged enough messages and the manuscript is thoroughly reviewed and revised, the conversation ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Creating a Summary**: Once the chat is over, a summary is created. This summary captures the main points of their discussion and the improvements made to the manuscript.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, a two-agent chat in this context is like a digital conversation between the Medical Researcher and Clinical Evaluator agents, where they take turns refining a medical manuscript, and we can later review the key points of their collaboration."

    "#### Understanding `initiate_chat` Method: Enabling Stateful Interactions in Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "The `initiate_chat` method is essential for creating stateful, memory-enabled interactions between agents. In agent architecture, ‚Äústatefulness‚Äù refers to an agent's ability to retain and utilize information from prior exchanges to shape its responses in real-time, maintaining continuity and relevance in multi-step tasks or ongoing conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **recipient**: Specifies the target agent for communication, allowing focused interactions that can adapt based on the agent's role or expertise. Each interaction is directed, keeping exchanges precise and task-oriented.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **message**: Sets the conversation‚Äôs initial context, enabling agents to start interactions with specific goals or conditions. This context-awareness is key to maintaining state, especially when the task involves progressive steps or detailed guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **max_turns**: Controls the number of message exchanges allowed, ensuring that the conversation is goal-oriented and efficient. This keeps the interactions concise, helping to avoid redundant back-and-forth exchanges.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **summary_method**: Offers ways to condense and recall key points from the conversation, like using the last message or a reflection summary via LLMs. Summaries create an efficient memory footprint, enabling agents to ‚Äúremember‚Äù critical insights without retaining every detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **clear_history**: Resets past interactions when needed, letting the agent start fresh without previous context. This is useful in tasks where each conversation needs independence from prior exchanges.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **cache and context**: Enable agents to reuse information without recalculating, and to pass additional information that is essential to the conversation. These elements enhance efficiency and continuity, allowing the agent to access relevant data across sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responses from `initiate_chat` are structured to provide comprehensive insights into the conversation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **content**: Contains the concluding message or content derived from the chat.\n",
    "- **history**: Captures the entire sequence of messages exchanged during the chat.\n",
    "- **summary**: Offers a condensed overview of the conversation, generated based on the specified `summary_method`."

      "\n",
      "## Abstract\n",
      "This study investigates the effects of a new pharmacological agent, identified as Drug X, on patients with heart disease. The objectives were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Drug X in reducing cardiovascular events and improving the overall heart function in diagnosed patients. The study utilized a randomized controlled trial design with a sample size of 500 participants. Results indicated a significant decrease in major cardiovascular events among the treatment group compared to the placebo group, with an acceptable safety profile. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Novel therapeutic agents with improved efficacy and safety profiles are imperative for advancing the treatment outcomes. Drug X, a novel compound exhibiting potent anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic properties, was hypothesized to reduce adverse cardiovascular events and improve cardiac function in patients with heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Methodology\n",
      "### Study Design\n",
      "The study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted over a period of 12 months. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Participants\n",
      "A total of 500 patients diagnosed with heart disease (defined as coronary artery disease confirmed by angiography) were enrolled. Patients were recruited from five major hospitals. Inclusion criteria were patients aged 40‚Äì75, with documented heart disease, and receiving standard-of-care treatment. Exclusion criteria included an ejection fraction <35%, recent MI (within 3 months), and severe comorbidities that could confound results.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Intervention\n",
      "Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Drug X (100 mg/day) or a matched placebo, alongside their standard cardiac medications.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Outcomes\n",
      "The primary outcome was the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. Secondary outcomes included changes in echocardiographic parameters (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV)), biomarkers of cardiac injury (troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)), and safety/tolerance including adverse events (AEs).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Statistical Analysis\n",
      "Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Categorical data were compared using Chi-square tests and continuous variables using unpaired t-tests or Mann-Whitney tests as appropriate. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated for time-to-event data, and differences between groups were assessed using the log-rank test. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Results\n",
      "### Participant Characteristics\n",
      "Out of 500 enrolled participants, 490 completed the study. Baseline characteristics were well-matched between the Drug X group and the placebo group.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Primary Outcome\n",
      "The incidence of MACE was significantly lower in the Drug X group compared to the placebo group (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.48-0.89, p=0.006). Specifically, cardiovascular death (2.5% vs 4.8%, p=0.04), MI (3.1% vs 5.9%, p=0.03), and stroke (2.2% vs 4.0%, p=0.05) were all reduced in the treatment group.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Secondary Outcomes\n",
      "Drug X resulted in improved LVEF (increased by 5.6%, p=0.01), reduced LVEDV (decreased by 12 mL, p=0.02), and lower levels of cardiac biomarkers (troponin and BNP) compared to the placebo. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Safety and Tolerance\n",
      "Drug X was well tolerated, with a similar incidence of adverse events between the two groups. Most common AEs were mild gastrointestinal discomfort and transient headaches. Serious adverse events were rare and comparable between groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Discussion\n",
      "The study demonstrated that Drug X significantly reduced the rate of composite MACE in patients with heart disease, along with improvements in cardiac function and reductions in biomarkers of cardiac injury. The findings suggest that Drug X could be a valuable addition to current therapeutic strategies for heart disease. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, limitations include the short follow-up period and the need for longer-term studies to confirm sustained benefits and safety. Further research should also consider diverse populations and real-world settings to evaluate generalizability.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "Drug X has shown promising results in reducing cardiovascular events and improving cardiac function in patients with heart disease. These findings warrant further investigation through larger and longer-duration trials to fully establish Drug X‚Äôs therapeutic potential and safety profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Ethical Considerations\n",
      "The study was conducted according to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the respective Institutional Review Boards (IRBs). All participants provided written informed consent prior to inclusion. Data confidentiality and participant anonymity were strictly maintained throughout the study.\n",

      "# Manuscript: Effects of a New Drug on Heart Disease\n",
      "\n",
      "## Abstract\n",
      "This study investigates the effects of a new pharmacological agent, identified as Drug X, on patients with heart disease. The objectives were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Drug X in reducing cardiovascular events and improving overall heart function in diagnosed patients. The study utilized a randomized controlled trial design with a sample size of 500 participants. Results indicated a significant decrease in major cardiovascular events among the treatment group compared to the placebo group (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.48-0.89, p=0.006), with an acceptable safety profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Novel therapeutic agents with improved efficacy and safety profiles are imperative for advancing treatment outcomes. Current treatments, although effective, often come with limitations such as adverse side effects or resistance over time. Drug X, a novel compound exhibiting potent anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic properties, distinguishes itself with a unique mechanism of action that may offer superior benefits compared to existing treatments. We hypothesized that Drug X would reduce adverse cardiovascular events and improve cardiac function in patients with heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Methodology\n",
      "### Study Design\n",
      "The study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted over 12 months. Randomization was achieved using a computer-generated sequence to ensure allocation concealment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Participants\n",
      "A total of 500 patients, aged 40-75, diagnosed with coronary artery disease confirmed by angiography were enrolled from five major hospitals. Inclusion criteria included documented heart disease and ongoing standard-of-care treatment. Exclusion criteria were an ejection fraction <35%, recent MI (within 3 months), and severe comorbidities that could confound results. Pre-study screening included specific blood tests and imaging to confirm eligibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Intervention\n",
      "Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Drug X (100 mg/day) or a matched placebo, alongside their standard cardiac medications. Blinding was maintained by ensuring that the placebo was identical in appearance to Drug X.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Outcomes\n",
      "The primary outcome was the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. Secondary outcomes included changes in echocardiographic parameters (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV)), biomarkers of cardiac injury (troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)), and safety/tolerance including adverse events (AEs).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Statistical Analysis\n",
      "Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Categorical data were compared using Chi-square tests and continuous variables using unpaired t-tests or Mann-Whitney tests as appropriate. Missing data were handled using multiple imputation methods. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated for time-to-event data, and differences between groups were assessed using the log-rank test. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Results\n",
      "### Participant Characteristics\n",
      "Out of 500 enrolled participants, 490 completed the study. Baseline characteristics were well-matched between the Drug X group and the placebo group (Table 1).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Primary Outcome\n",
      "The incidence of MACE was significantly lower in the Drug X group compared to the placebo group (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.48-0.89, p=0.006). Specifically, cardiovascular death (2.5% vs 4.8%, p=0.04), MI (3.1% vs 5.9%, p=0.03), and stroke (2.2% vs 4.0%, p=0.05) were all reduced in the treatment group.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Secondary Outcomes\n",
      "Drug X resulted in improved LVEF (increased by 5.6%, p=0.01), reduced LVEDV (decreased by 12 mL, p=0.02), and lower levels of cardiac biomarkers (troponin and BNP) compared to the placebo. These results are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Safety and Tolerance\n",
      "Drug X was well tolerated, with a similar incidence of adverse events between the two groups. The most common AEs were mild gastrointestinal discomfort and transient headaches. Serious adverse events were rare and comparable between groups. Adverse events were closely monitored following a predetermined protocol.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Discussion\n",
      "The study demonstrated that Drug X significantly reduced the rate of composite MACE in patients with heart disease, along with improvements in cardiac function and reductions in biomarkers of cardiac injury. The findings suggest that Drug X could be a valuable addition to current therapeutic strategies for heart disease. Potential mechanisms for Drug X‚Äôs effects include its anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic properties. \n",
      "\n",
      "Subgroup analyses indicated more pronounced benefits in younger patients and those without diabetes, pointing towards specific populations that might benefit most from Drug X. Limitations of the study include the short follow-up period and the need for longer-term studies to confirm sustained benefits and safety. Selection bias and reporting bias were minimized through rigorous adherence to the study protocol, though these factors should be explored further in future research.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "Drug X has shown promising results in reducing cardiovascular events and improving cardiac function in patients with heart disease. These findings warrant further investigation through larger and longer-duration trials to fully establish Drug X‚Äôs therapeutic potential and safety profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Ethical Considerations\n",
      "The study was conducted according to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the respective Institutional Review Boards (IRBs). All participants provided written informed consent prior to inclusion. Adverse events were closely monitored through a predetermined protocol, ensuring participant safety. Data confidentiality and participant anonymity were strictly maintained throughout the study.\n",

      "\n",
      "**1. Abstract**\n",
      "The study evaluates the effectiveness of telemedicine in managing chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and COPD. A randomized control trial was conducted with 300 participants over six months, comparing telemedicine with traditional in-person care. Results showed significant improvements in health outcomes, including an average HbA1c reduction of 1.4%, systolic blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg, and enhanced lung function. Patient satisfaction scores were significantly higher in the telemedicine group (average score of 4.6/5) compared to the control group (3.8/5). Additionally, healthcare utilization decreased, with 30% fewer emergency visits and 20% fewer hospital admissions, highlighting telemedicine as a viable and potentially superior alternative to traditional healthcare delivery.\n",

    "\n",
    "The **nested chat pattern** involves integrating multiple conversation threads within a single overarching dialogue. This approach allows complex tasks to be broken down into subtasks, each handled by specialized agents within their own sub-conversations, or \"nested chats.\" These nested chats enable agents to delve deeper into specific aspects of a task without interrupting the main conversation flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Application: Enhancing Clinical Evaluation with Legal and Ethical Experts\n",
    "\n",
    "In our medical document review process, we implement the nested chat pattern by incorporating legal and ethical experts into the clinical evaluation. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Main Conversation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The primary dialogue involves the **Medical Researcher**, **Clinical Evaluator**, and **Medical Editor** collaborating to produce and refine a medical research document.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Nested Chats within Clinical Evaluation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Within the clinical evaluation step, we introduce nested chats to integrate specialized reviews:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - **Legal Expert Nested Chat**:\n",
    "       - The **Legal Expert** conducts a legal review of the document.\n",
    "       - Checks for compliance with laws, regulations, and intellectual property rights.\n",
    "       - Identifies any legal issues or considerations that need addressing.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     - **Ethical Expert Nested Chat**:\n",
    "       - The **Ethical Expert** performs an ethical assessment.\n",
    "       - Ensures the study adheres to ethical guidelines and standards.\n",
    "       - Highlights any ethical concerns or necessary approvals.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Integration of Feedback**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Clinical Evaluator**:\n",
    "     - Receives detailed reports from the legal and ethical experts.\n",
    "     - Integrates their feedback into the overall evaluation.\n",
    "     - Addresses any identified issues in collaboration with the Medical Researcher.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Continuation of Main Conversation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The revised document, now vetted for clinical, legal, and ethical standards, is passed to the **Medical Editor**.\n",
    "   - The Medical Editor finalizes the document for publication."

      "\n",
      "#### 6. Data Integrity and Intention-to-Treat Analysis:\n",
      "**Issue:**\n",
      "Although it is mentioned that data were analyzed using intention-to-treat principles, the handling of missing data or dropouts is not described.\n",
      "**Suggestion:**\n",
      "Include a description of how missing data and dropouts were handled in the analysis. Specify any imputation methods used and their rationale.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 7. Unblinding Procedures:\n",
      "**Issue:**\n",
      "There is no mention of how blinding was maintained and the procedures for emergency unblinding if needed.\n",
      "**Suggestion:**\n",
      "Add a section detailing the measures taken to maintain blinding and describe any unblinding procedures available during the trial for safety reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 8. Statement of Compliance:\n",
      "**Issue:**\n",
      "There is no mention of compliance with any relevant regulatory standards or guidelines.\n",
      "**Suggestion:**\n",
      "Include a statement confirming that the study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki or other relevant ethical guidelines (such as GCP - Good Clinical Practice).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 9. Statistical Analysis Details:\n",
      "**Issue:**\n",
      "The statistical methods are briefly mentioned but lack detail about how sample size was calculated and the handling of multiple comparisons.\n",
      "**Suggestion:**\n",
      "Provide a more detailed section on the statistical analysis plan, including sample size calculation, handling of multiple comparisons to control type I error, and any additional statistical tests used.\n",
      "\n",
      "With these revisions, the document will enhance its adherence to ethical, legal, and regulatory requirements, improving its integrity and compliance with good clinical practice standards.\n",

      "\n",
      "#### Abstract\n",
      "\n",
      "**Objective:** To evaluate the efficacy and safety of CardiRx, a new therapeutic drug, in the treatment of heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Methods:** This study employed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial design. A total of 300 participants with diagnosed heart disease were randomly assigned to receive either CardiRx or a placebo for 12 months. Primary outcomes included changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), and quality of life (QoL) scores. Secondary outcomes included monitoring for drug-related adverse events and changes in biomarkers of myocardial injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Results:** Participants receiving CardiRx showed a significant improvement in LVEF compared to the placebo group (p < 0.01). The incidence of MACE was also lower in the CardiRx group (p < 0.05). QoL scores were markedly higher in the treatment group than in the control group (p < 0.01). Adverse events were minimal and similar in both groups, indicating a favorable safety profile for CardiRx.\n",

      "#### Abstract\n",
      "\n",
      "**Objective:** To evaluate the efficacy and safety of CardiRx, a new therapeutic drug, in the treatment of heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Methods:** This study employed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial design. A total of 300 participants with diagnosed heart disease were randomly assigned to receive either CardiRx or a placebo for 12 months. Primary outcomes included changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), and quality of life (QoL) scores. Secondary outcomes included monitoring for drug-related adverse events and changes in biomarkers of myocardial injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Results:** Participants receiving CardiRx showed a significant improvement in LVEF compared to the placebo group (p < 0.01). The incidence of MACE was also lower in the CardiRx group (p < 0.05). QoL scores were markedly higher in the treatment group than in the control group (p < 0.01). Adverse events were minimal and similar in both groups, indicating a favorable safety profile for CardiRx.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:** CardiRx demonstrates significant therapeutic efficacy in improving cardiac function and reducing the incidence of adverse cardiac events in patients with heart disease, with a favorable safety profile.\n",

Lipoprotein entry, retention, and oxidative modification cause endothelial damage, triggering innate and adaptive immune responses. Recruited immune cells orchestrate the early atherosclerotic lesions by releasing proinflammatory cytokines, expediting the foam cell formation, intraplaque haemorrhage, secretion of matrix-degrading enzymes, and lesion progression, eventually promoting coronary artery syndrome via various inflammatory cascades. In addition, soluble mediators disrupt the dynamic anti- and prothrombotic balance maintained by endothelial cells and pave the way for coronary artery disease such as angina pectoris. Recent studies have established a relationship between elevated levels of inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukins (IL-6, IL-1Œ≤), and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Œ±) with the severity of CAD and the possibility of future cardiovascular events. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is a marker for assessing systemic inflammation and predicting the risk of developing CAD based on its peak plasma levels. Hence, understanding cross-talk interactions of inflammation, atherogenesis, and CAD is highly warranted to recalculate the risk factors that activate and propagate arterial lesions and devise therapeutic strategies accordingly. Cholesterol-inflammation lowering agents (statins), monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-1 and IL-6 (canakinumab and tocilizumab), disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (methotrexate), sodium-glucose transport protein-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, colchicine and xanthene oxidase inhibitor (allopurinol) have shown promising results in reducing inflammation, regressing atherogenic plaque and modifying the course of CAD.

We review here how these advances have altered our concepts of and clinical approaches to both the chronic and acute phases of CAD. Previously considered a cholesterol storage disease, we currently view atherosclerosis as an inflammatory disorder. The appreciation of arterial remodeling (compensatory enlargement) has expanded attention beyond stenoses evident by angiography to encompass the biology of nonstenotic plaques. Revascularization effectively relieves ischemia, but we now recognize the need to attend to nonobstructive lesions as well. Aggressive management of modifiable risk factors reduces cardiovascular events and should accompany appropriate revascularization. We now recognize that disruption of plaques that may not produce critical stenoses causes many acute coronary syndromes (ACS).

Atherosclerotic lesions \\ngrow slowly over the years, eventually impeding blood flow \\nand leading to the clinical manifestation of stable angina \\nor claudication. However, obstructive and nonobstructive \\nlesions may also erode or abruptly rupture, resulting in the \\nlocal accumulation of tissue factor and platelet activation, \\nculminating in rapid thrombotic vascular occlusion and \\nlife-threatening conditions, such as myocardial infarction, \\nstroke, acute limb ischemia, and cardiovascular death.\\nPlease see www.ahajournals.org/atvb/atvb-focus  \\nfor all articles published in this series.\\nMACROPHAGES IN ASCVD \\nPROGRESSION\\nPredominantly derived from circulating monocytes and \\nlocal proliferation,5‚Äì8 macrophage numbers increase up \\nto 20-fold within mouse aortae during atherogenesis.2,9,10 \\nAdditionally, there is evidence that vascular smooth mus-\\ncle cells can dedifferentiate to a plaque macrophage-\\nlike state.11‚Äì14 Recruitment of monocytes into the intimal \\nspace is a process that occurs early in life, with the ini-\\ntial stages evident in infants less than a year old,15,16 and \\nATVB IN FOCUS - AL\\nBarrett\\b\\nMacrophages in Atherosclerosis Regression\\nArterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2020;40:20‚Äì33.

Foam cell buildup contributes to plaque lipid \\nstorage and sustained plaque growth.10,20 Macrophages \\ncontribute to the maintenance of the local inflammatory \\nresponse by secreting proinflammatory cytokines, chemo-\\nkines, and producing reactive oxygen and nitrogen spe-\\ncies. Additionally, macrophages engage in crosstalk with \\nvascular smooth muscle cells, amplifying the inflammatory \\ncycle by producing additional proinflammatory cytokines \\nand extracellular matrix components, further promoting \\nthe retention of lipoproteins.2,21 Plaque macrophages \\nhave a decreased ability to migrate, impeding inflamma-\\ntion resolution, promoting the progression of lesions into \\ncomplicated, rupture-prone plaques. Moreover, this per-\\nsistent inflammation drives macrophage apoptosis, and in \\nthe absence of efficient efferocytosis, leads to the accu-\\nmulation of debris and apoptotic cells, facilitating necrotic \\ncore formation in atherosclerotic plaque.2,10,22\\nA defining feature of macrophages is their plastic-\\nity, which allows them to produce a tailored response to \\nlocal microenvironment stimuli.23‚Äì26 During inflammation, \\nmacrophages may act to either promote inflammation or \\nresolve it during wound and tissue repair.24,27 The classical \\nmodel of macrophage activation defines both pro- and anti-\\ninflammatory macrophages with distinct physiological roles \\nand activators. At the broadest level, macrophages are clas-\\nsified as either M1, classically activated, or M2, alternatively \\nactivated.23,28 In vitro, M1 macrophages polarize in response \\nto toll-like receptor ligands, interferons, pathogen-associated \\nmolecular complexes, lipopolysaccharides, and lipoproteins. \\nFueled primarily by glycolysis,29 M1 macrophages contrib-\\nute to tissue destruction and secrete pro-inflammatory fac-\\ntors including high levels of IL (interleukin)-1Œ≤, IL-6, and \\nTNF-Œ± (tumor necrosis factor-Œ±).26,30,31 Consistent with their \\ninflammatory phenotype, they express pro-inflammatory \\ntranscription factors, including nuclear factor-Œ∫B and STAT \\n(signal transducer and activator of transcription)-1. M2 mac-\\nrophages are at the other end of the spectrum with a fatty \\nacid oxidation dependent-phenotype and anti-inflammatory \\nproperties.32 M2 macrophages are polarized in response to \\nthe cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 and secrete anti-inflammatory \\nfactors such as the IL-1 receptor agonist, IL-10 and colla-\\ngen. M2 macrophages are characterized by their expression \\nof CD163 (cluster of differentiation 163), mannose receptor \\n1, resistin like-Œ≤, and high levels of arginase-1.\\nIn the context of plaques, macrophages adhering to \\nboth the classically activated and alternatively activated \\nsubsets are present in human and mouse lesions, with \\nM1 as the predominant subtype.33‚Äì37 In human lesions, \\nmacrophages expressing proinflammatory markers are \\nin rupture-prone, unstable regions, and M2-like macro-\\nphages in stable regions and the adventitia.38‚Äì43 How-\\never, recent evidence suggests that macrophages exist \\non an activation continuum and that the M1/M2 clas-\\nsification system is an oversimplification of macrophage \\nheterogeneity and their diverse functions.36,43,44\\nIn the context of murine ASCVD, several alternative \\nmacrophage classifications are described.36,45 These \\nalternate phenotypes include hemorrhage-residing Mhem \\nNonstandard Abbreviations and Acronyms\\nAPC\\t\\nantigen-presenting cell\\napoB\\t\\napolipoprotein B\\nASCVD\\t\\natherosclerotic cardiovascular disease\\nCCR7\\t\\nC-C chemokine receptor type 7\\nFOURIER\\t\\n\\u0007Further Cardiovascular Outcomes \\nResearch With PCSK9 Inhibition in \\nSubjects with Elevated Risk\\nHDL-C\\t\\nhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol\\nHSP\\t\\nheat shock protein\\nIL\\t\\ninterleukin\\nKLF4\\t\\nKr√ºppel-like factor 4\\nLDL\\t\\nlow-density lipoprotein\\nLDL-C\\t\\nLDL cholesterol\\nLDLR\\t\\nLDL receptor\\nLXR\\t\\nliver X receptor\\nMERTK\\t\\ntyrosine-protein kinase MER\\nPCSK9\\t\\n\\u0007proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin \\ntype 9\\nSTAT\\t\\n\\u0007signal transducer and activator of \\ntranscription\\nTNF-Œ±\\t\\ntumor necrosis factor-Œ±\\nTregs\\t\\nregulatory T cell\\nTREM\\t\\n\\u0007termed triggering receptor expressed \\non myeloid cells 2\\nHighlights\\n‚Ä¢\\t Macrophages in atherosclerotic cardiovascular \\ndisease play a central role in the development of \\nplaques.\\n‚Ä¢\\t Classically activated M1 macrophages are impli-\\ncated in initiating and sustaining inflammation, \\nand alternatively activated or M2 macrophages are \\nlinked to inflammation resolution.\\n‚Ä¢\\t Macrophage plasticity makes them attractive thera-\\npeutic targets to stem the development of and sta-\\nbilize existing atherosclerosis.\\n‚Ä¢\\t Understanding the basis of metabolic and epigenetic \\nreprogramming of macrophage polarization is antici-\\npated to translate to new therapeutic opportunities \\nto promote atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease \\nregression to reduce residual inflammatory risk.\\nATVB IN FOCUS - AL\\nBarrett\\b\\nMacrophages in Atherosclerosis Regression\\n22‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÇ January 2020\\b\\nArterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2020;40:20‚Äì33.

Additionally, whether results in \\nmice are translatable to human plaques, which have distinct \\nphenotypic differences (eg, hemorrhage and rupture), is \\nessential to determine for the development of therapies to \\nreduce macrophage-associated residual inflammatory risk.\\nATHEROSCLEROSIS REGRESSION\\nMacrophages are the hallmarks of ASCVD contribut-\\ning to plaque development, local inflammation, and the \\npromotion of thrombosis. This central role, coupled with \\ntheir plasticity, makes macrophages attractive therapeu-\\ntic targets to stem the progression of plaques and stabi-\\nlize existing atherosclerosis.\\nStudies in the 1970s undertaken in nonhuman primates \\nand pigs made the initial observations of macrophages con-\\ntributing to atherosclerosis regression.61‚Äì63 These seminal \\nstudies employed atherogenic high-fat, high-cholesterol diets \\nto induce atherosclerosis progression and subsequent low-fat, \\nlow-cholesterol diets to reduce hypercholesterolemia. In both \\nmodels, 4 to 6 months of regression diet feeding decreased \\naortic lesion macrophage foam cells, reduced necrotic plaque \\narea, and increased the thickness and density of fibrous caps. \\nAn ASCVD regression review in 1985 stated, ‚Äúit is obvious \\nthat the role of macrophages in regression may be very com-\\nplex and a comprehensive study of such is unattainable by a \\nsingle experiment by one or a small group of investigators‚Äù.61 \\nSince then, the generation of hyperlipidemic mouse mod-\\nels,64‚Äì66 extensively used to model human ASCVD,67,68 which \\nallow for the rapid, reproducible development of plaques, has \\nfurther increased the field‚Äôs understanding of the regulators \\nof plaque progression. In 2001, in response to the need for \\nfurther murine atherosclerosis model development basic \\nresearch into the mechanisms that govern ASCVD regres-\\nsion or stabilization was stimulated by the establishment of \\nan aortic transplantation approach.64\\nClinical trials in humans have demonstrated that robust \\ncholesterol reduction prevents major adverse cardio-\\nvascular events.65,66 Imaging studies using intravascular \\nultrasound and optical coherence tomography suggest \\nthat dramatic LDL (low-density lipoprotein) lowering (ie, \\nstatins, PCSK9 [proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin \\ntype 9] inhibition) prevents plaque progression and may \\neven induce plaque regression.67‚Äì70 The development of \\nLDL-C (LDL cholesterol)-lowering therapies that facilitate \\nunprecedented reductions in LDL-C, relative to traditional \\nstatins, are likely to provide further insight into the role of \\nresidual inflammatory risk and plaque progression and \\nregression.22,71‚Äì74 Advances in imaging techniques pro-\\nvide insight into the compositional changes in remodeling \\nplaques.75 Optical coherence tomography allows detailed \\nvisualization of plaques and provides information on plaque \\ncomposition (eg, lipids and calcification) and thickness of \\nthe fibrous cap, a classical marker of plaque inflammation \\nand vulnerability. Given that plaque lipid concentrations are \\npositively associated with macrophage accumulation, this \\nrelationship provides indirect evidence for reduced plaque \\nmacrophage count during human ASCVD regression.76\\nEvidence for monocyte and macrophage phenotypes \\nassociated with plaque vulnerability are derived from \\nplaques taken from subjects with different stages of ath-\\nerosclerosis.41‚Äì43,77 However, translation of macrophage \\nstudies in mice to human ASCVD regression carries the \\ncaveat that responses of monocyte-derived macrophages \\nfrom mice and humans are still needed to be compared \\nside-by-side.24 Further imaging advancements indicate \\nATVB IN FOCUS - AL\\nBarrett\\b\\nMacrophages in Atherosclerosis Regression\\nArterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2020;40:20‚Äì33.

All models begin with a progression phase \\nto establish a baseline plaque in which plasma apoB lipo-\\nprotein levels are high (LDL-C >300 mg/dL), followed by \\na phase of low atherogenic lipoprotein levels (VLDL [very-\\nlow‚Äìdensity lipoprotein] and LDL-C) to induce regression. \\nPreclinical models of ASCVD regression are considered \\nanalogous to high-intensity statin treatment in humans.81\\nPlaque Transplantation\\nRepresenting the first ASCVD model of regression, the \\nplaque transplant model involves transplanting an athero-\\nsclerotic thoracic arch64 or aortic arch segment82,83 from a \\nhyperlipidemic donor mouse (eg, ApoE‚àí/‚àí or Ldlr‚àí/‚àí) into \\na normolipidemic recipient mouse (ie, C57Bl/6J). The \\nrapid change in atherogenic apoB lipoproteins induces \\nplaque regression, characterized by decreased lesion, \\nmacrophage, and lipid areas over a short period.34,64,74,84,85 \\nThis original model has been instrumental in elucidat-\\ning mechanisms that contribute to regression and the \\nassessment of ASCVD-reducing therapies.30,74,86,87\\nElimination of Atherogenic Lipoprotein \\nProduction\\nReversa mice are LDLR (LDL receptor) deficient and \\ngenetically modified via the introduction of a conditional \\nallele of Mttp (microsomal triglyceride transfer protein) \\nin the liver (Ldlr‚àí/‚àíApob100/100Mttpfl/flMx1-Cre+/+) and \\ncan serve as a reversible ASCVD model.88 Inhibition of \\nmicrosomal triglyceride transfer protein (IFN-Œ± [inter-\\nferon-alpha], IFN-Œ≤, or synthetic double-stranded RNA \\n[eg, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, pIpC]), in conjunction \\nwith a switch to a chow diet, results in reduced VLDL \\nand LDL (apoB lipoprotein cholesterol; >1000 mg/dL to \\n<150 mg/dL) and rapid regression of plaques.89 Similar \\nchanges in atherogenic lipoproteins and plaque regres-\\nsion can also be achieved in Ldlr‚àí/‚àí mice treated with the \\nmicrosomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor, such \\nas BMS 212122.90 Additionally, the elimination of apoB \\nproduction with an Apob antisense oligonucleotide pro-\\nmotes ASCVD regression in Ldlr‚àí/‚àí mice.91\\nModulation of LDL Receptor or ApoE \\nExpression\\nEarly lipid lowering approaches in mice used adeno-\\nassociated virus therapies to induce hepatic overexpres-\\nsion of Apoe in ApoE‚àí/‚àí mice and Ldlr in Ldlr‚àí/‚àí mice.92‚Äì94 \\nRecent studies in wild-type mice have also described the \\nutility of LDLR antisense oligonucleotides in raising apoB \\nlipoprotein cholesterol levels and withdrawal of the anti-\\nsense oligonucleotide and subsequent antagonism with \\nsense oligonucleotides to accelerate the reduction of \\nlipid levels and facilitate regression.95 Similarly, increas-\\ning PCSK9 levels, a protein that directs hepatic LDLR for \\ndegradation,96 elevates circulating LDL-C and induces \\natherosclerosis in wild-type mice.37,97‚Äì99 The PCSK9 \\nadeno-associated virus model can be used for regression \\nstudies by a diet switch to chow, with lipid lowering further \\naccelerated by the inclusion of an microsomal triglycer-\\nide transfer protein inhibitor to the diet.37 Given that they \\noverride the necessity for complicated and time-consum-\\ning backcrosses, ASCVD models that are genotype-inde-\\npendent will facilitate the relatively rapid assessment of \\nfactors that regulate ASCVD regression. Further, mecha-\\nnistic work will benefit from the rapid induction of gene-\\nspecific phenotypes in adult mice with established lesions \\nto test candidates that may regulate regression.100\\nReduction in Dietary Cholesterol\\nA simple switch in diet from an atherogenic high-fat, \\nhigh-cholesterol diet to a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet in \\nsome atherosclerosis-prone mouse models is sufficient to \\ninduce ASCVD regression and comparable to the use of \\nstatins or beneficial dietary changes in humans. However, \\nthis method of regression is slower and, in some mice apoB \\nlipoprotein cholesterol levels (eg, ApoE‚àí/‚àí mice) may not \\nnormalize to sufficient levels to achieve regression.37,101,102\\nMACROPHAGES IN ASCVD REGRESSION\\nPlaque macrophage content is determined by monocyte \\nrecruitment and macrophage proliferation, emigration, \\nand death.2 Historically, atherosclerosis studies have \\nplaced a significant emphasis on understanding mech-\\nanisms of monocyte recruitment into the vascular wall \\nand devising strategies to block their influx into plaques.2 \\nHowever, recent studies show that there are also factors \\nthat determine macrophage retention within plaques,10 \\nand it is hypothesized that if these processes are favor-\\nably modulated, plaque macrophage content may be \\nreduced and ASCVD regression achieved.\\nATVB IN FOCUS - AL\\nBarrett\\b\\nMacrophages in Atherosclerosis Regression\\n24‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÇ January 2020\\b\\nArterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2020;40:20‚Äì33.

Thus, it \\nis hypothesized that lipid lowering induces plaque macro-\\nphage CCR7 expression and migration.85,108 In mice defi-\\ncient in low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1, \\na separate group independently presented evidence for \\na role of CCR7 in regression. During regression, LRP-1 \\n(low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1) defi-\\nciency increased macrophage cholesterol efflux and \\nCCR7 expression and promoted macrophage emigration \\nto lymph nodes and plaque regression.109\\nEpigenome-guided analysis of the transcriptome of \\nplaque macrophages during ASCVD regression revealed \\nactivation of the Wnt signaling pathway.107 Given that in \\nmacrophages, Wnt signaling promotes cell motility through \\na Œ≤-catenin-dependent mechanism,110 and Œ≤-catenin \\nknockdown promotes atherosclerosis progression,111 this \\npathway may represent an unexplored regulator of ASCVD \\nregression. Additionally, the macrophage retention factors, \\nnetrin 1 and semaphorin 3E, transcripts differentially reg-\\nulated in progressing and regressing plaques, also hold \\npromise as potential mediators of plaque macrophage \\ncontent given their ability to modulate macrophage reten-\\ntion and migration in progressing plaques.2,54,112,113\\nMonitoring plaque macrophage flux is an essential com-\\nponent in the assessment of the effectiveness of therapies \\ndesigned to promote ASCVD regression. The most readily \\nused technique in murine regression studies takes advan-\\ntage of the ability of monocytes to take up fluorophore-\\nlabeled beads (eg, Rahman et al,74 Nagareddy et al,86 Distel \\net al,103 and Potteaux et al114). The monocyte bead label-\\ning technique can be used to monitor plaque monocyte \\nentry and macrophage egress.89 To monitor entry, mice are \\ninjected intravenously with beads before harvest (typically \\n24‚Äì72 hours), and to monitor macrophage egress, mice \\nare injected with beads before the induction of regression \\n(typically 24‚Äì96 hours). Quantification of bead-bearing \\ncells in plaques at the time of harvest allows for the assess-\\nment of monocyte and macrophage trafficking.\\nThis technique represents a relatively rapid and \\nstraightforward labeling procedure and does not alter \\nthe phenotype of bead-bearing cells.115 The predominant \\ndrawback of this approach is the relatively low incorpora-\\ntion of beads into circulating monocytes (‚âà5%‚Äì10%) and \\nthe selectivity of Ly6Clo monocytes in taking up the beads, \\nthe monocyte subset with reduced capacity to enter \\nlesions. Prior injection of mice with clodronate liposomes, \\nto deplete all circulating monocytes, can skew bead label-\\ning to the Ly6Chi subset.116 However, this comes with \\nthe inherent drawback of potential depletion of plaque-\\nresiding macrophages given their ability to deplete mac-\\nrophage populations in the spleen, bone marrow, and \\nliver.116,117 Alternatively, Ly6Chi monocytes may be labeled \\nwith the modified thymidine analog EdU (5-ethynyl-2¬¥-\\ndeoxyuridine) that at time points less than 72 hours is \\nselectively incorporated in the Ly6Chi subset.74,114 Ly6Chi \\nmonocytes that enter plaques are determined by staining \\nfor EdU. Dual staining with the proliferation marker Ki67 \\nallows for the distinction between recruited monocytes, \\nand macrophages proliferating in situ.\\nFluorescent reporter lines (eg, GFP-CD68 [green flu-\\norescent protein CD68], CX3CR1-GFP [CX3C chemo-\\nkine receptor 1 green fluorescent protein]) and congenic \\nmice (eg, CD45.1, CD45.2) also allow for monitoring \\nplaque monocyte/macrophage trafficking.104,116 The util-\\nity of these models is best suited to regression studies \\nundertaken in the transplant model, as this allows for dif-\\nferential labeling of either donor plaque cells or recipient \\ncirculating cells to assess regression-mediated changes. \\nThe utilization of inducible reporter lines (eg, CreloxP or \\nFLP-FRT [flippase/flippase recognition target] system) \\nthat could be triggered at the time of regression also rep-\\nresents a viable method to track myeloid cell trafficking in \\ntransplant-free regression models. Fluorescent reporter \\nlines represent a useful model to monitor monocyte/\\nmacrophage flux via intravital imaging. However, the rela-\\ntively short monitoring window and the need to expose \\nthe site of interest to detect signals limit this approach.\\nMacrophage Polarization\\nMacrophage polarization is considered a dynamic pro-\\ncess,23,26 and editing of this potential is an emerging \\ntherapeutic area for a variety of inflammation-based dis-\\norders.23,118 M1 macrophages characterize progression \\nlesions while regressing plaques are enriched in M2 mac-\\nrophages.69 M2 macrophage enrichment in plaque regres-\\nsion is consistent with the view that M1 macrophages are \\npro-atherogenic and promote an unstable plaque, while \\nATVB IN FOCUS - AL\\nBarrett\\b\\nMacrophages in Atherosclerosis Regression\\nArterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2020;40:20‚Äì33.

Alternate possibilities for plaque M2 macrophage \\nenrichment during regression are (1) egress of M1 mac-\\nrophages from plaques, (2) entry of monocytes and their \\npolarization to M2 macrophages, and (3) proliferation of \\nresident yolk-sac-derived M2 macrophages.6,122\\nIn atherogenic mice, the deletion of NR4A1, a transcrip-\\ntion factor that regulates the Ly6Clo monocyte phenotype \\nand favors M2 macrophage differentiation,123 results in \\nplaque M1 macrophage enrichment and accelerates ath-\\nerosclerosis.124,125 Similarly, the deletion of the transcrip-\\ntion factor KLF4 (Kr√ºppel-like factor 4), which promotes \\nM2 and inhibits M1 macrophage polarization,126 enhances \\npro-inflammatory M1 macrophage activation, foam cell for-\\nmation, and accelerates atherosclerosis in ApoE‚àí/‚àí mice.127 \\nLikewise, stimulation of the PPAR-Œ≥ (peroxisome prolifer-\\nator-activated receptor-gamma) pathway, which promotes \\nM2 macrophage polarization,128 decreases atherosclerosis \\ndevelopment in the ApoE‚àí/‚àí and Reversa mice.89,129 Simi-\\nlarly, loss of Akt2 enhances the ability of macrophages to \\npolarize to the M2 state and suppresses atherogenesis.130 \\nTreatment of Ldlr‚àí/‚àí mice with the M2-polarizing cytokine \\nIL-13 promotes a plaque M2 macrophage phenotype, \\nalong with an increase in plaque collagen content, and a \\nreduction in monocyte recruitment in lesions and macro-\\nphage content.131 However, it remains to be established \\nwhether the mechanisms that promote or hinder macro-\\nphage M2 polarization under conditions of hypercholes-\\nterolemia can be applied to regressing plaques.\\nA recent study reported that after reversal of hyper-\\ncholesterolemia, the recruitment of Ly6Chi monocytes and \\ntheir STAT6-dependent conversion to M2 macrophages \\nis essential for reducing plaque macrophage content and \\nsuppression of ACSVD inflammation during regression.74 \\nTo date, the factors that regulate STAT6-signaling to medi-\\nate this change are unknown, but given IL-4 and IL-13 \\nfacilitate M2 polarization through a STAT6-dependent \\npathway, it is hypothesized that local production of these \\ncytokines (eg, by basophils, eosinophils) during regression \\nmay mediate this process. Important to note, however, are \\nfindings in an alternate model of plaque regression, which \\nfound that suppression of monocyte recruitment is essen-\\ntial for plaque macrophage regression.114 This is consistent \\nwith studies in diabetic mice showing impaired regres-\\nsion after lipid lowering because of increased monocyte \\nrecruitment.103 These findings in different murine models \\nof regression reveal that many different pathways posi-\\ntively affect the regression of established plaques. They \\nalso highlight that despite robust apoB lipoprotein lower-\\ning, plaques did not regress completely, providing evidence \\nfor additional unidentified mechanisms that contribute to \\nresidual inflammatory risk during regression exist.\\nA defined function of macrophages is their effero-\\ncytotic capacity, an essential process for the resolution \\nof inflammation and plaque stabilization by reducing \\nnecrotic core area.132,133 Macrophage efferocytosis, refer-\\nring to their ability to clear apoptotic cells and debris, is \\nmediated through receptors including MERTK (tyrosine-\\nprotein kinase MER), LRP-1 and CD47 and is regarded \\nas a protective anti-inflammatory function of M2 macro-\\nphages.134,135 Thus, enrichment of M2 macrophages, or \\nenhancement of macrophage efferocytotic capacity (eg, \\nvia PPAR-Œ≥ activation136), may represent a viable strategy \\nto promote ASCVD regression and plaque stabilization.\\nRecent studies demonstrate that macrophage inflam-\\nmatory responses and their metabolism are codepen-\\ndent.137 Classically activated M1 macrophages shift to \\nanabolic metabolism by upregulating either glycolysis or \\nthe pentose-phosphate pathway, while M2 macrophages \\nare fueled by oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid \\noxidation.138 In the context of ASCVD, environmental sig-\\nnals including hyperlipidemia, hypoxia, and hyperglycemia \\nskew macrophage polarization toward a glycolytic inflam-\\nmatory M1-like phenotype, a macrophage phenotype of \\nboth unstable murine and human plaques.77,86,103,139‚Äì142 \\nHow metabolic shifts in macrophages contribute to lesion \\nprogression and stability and the changes that occur after \\nLDL-C lowering are currently unknown. However, pre-\\nclinical studies provide insight into how reprogramming of \\nmacrophages to an anti-inflammatory M2-like phenotype \\nsuppresses plaque progression. Antagonism of miR-33, \\na microRNA elevated in macrophages in progressing \\nlesions, promotes regression105 and skews macrophages \\ntowards an M2 state, as evidenced by increased mRNA \\nexpression of genes encoding AMP kinase and fatty \\nacid oxidation, elevated mitochondrial respiration, and \\ndecreased glycolysis.102 Additionally, the treatment of \\nLdlr‚àí/‚àí mice with the M2-polarizing cytokine IL-13 inhibits \\natherosclerosis progression, in part by its ability to skew \\nplaque macrophage phenotype towards an M2 state.131\\nCholesterol Efflux\\nDuring ASCVD plaque regression, reductions in athero-\\ngenic apoB lipoproteins result in an improved HDL-C (high-\\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol) to LDL-C ratio. Increased \\nconcentrations of functional HDL particles are likely to \\nrepresent a significant contributor to ASCVD regression, \\ngiven their ability to mediate cholesterol efflux, facilitate \\nfoam cell migration, and induce M2 polarization.85,120,143 In \\nvitro, treatment of macrophages with HDL enhances the \\nexpression of M2 macrophage markers (arginase 1 and \\nretnlb) in a STAT6-dependent process120 and induces the \\ntranscriptional regulator ATF3, a repressor of inflamma-\\ntion.144 Given that ATF3 activates Wnt/Œ≤-catenin signaling \\nin macrophages to mediate migration,145 a process that is \\nATVB IN FOCUS - AL\\nBarrett\\b\\nMacrophages in Atherosclerosis Regression\\n26‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÇ January 2020\\b\\nArterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2020;40:20‚Äì33.

LXR is a transcription factor that induces the \\nexpression of genes involved in cholesterol transport and \\nefflux151,152 and is essential for retarding atherosclero-\\nsis progression and promoting atherosclerosis regres-\\nsion.84,153 Additionally, the nonspecific efflux molecule, \\ncyclodextrin, promotes atherosclerosis regression via \\nLXR-mediated macrophage reprogramming to improve \\ncholesterol efflux and exert anti-inflammatory effects.154\\nThe lymphatic vasculature, localized in the adventi-\\ntia, may also represent an underappreciated pathway \\ncontributing to ASCVD regression.155 In murine models, \\nthe lymphatic system was shown to be a critical com-\\nponent of reverse cholesterol transport, facilitating the \\neffective removal of cholesterol effluxed from plaque \\nmacrophages.155,156 In the aortic transplant model, lym-\\nphatic-mediated reverse cholesterol transport accounted \\nfor 50% of cholesterol delivery from cholesterol-loaded \\nmacrophages into the plasma compartment and was \\nessential for ASCVD regression.156 In mice, hypercho-\\nlesterolemia is proposed to induce lymphatic dysfunc-\\ntion and drive atherosclerosis.157,158 While it remains to be \\nestablished whether lymphatic function is restored after \\ncholesterol-lowering in mice, experimental evidence indi-\\ncates that during the regression phase, plaque choles-\\nterol content is reduced and monocyte-derived cells exit \\nplaques with some reaching lymph nodes.156 However, a \\nrecent report indicates that the proximity of a macrophage \\nto the lymphatic vasculature before lipid lowering deter-\\nmines its egress capacity, rather than functional changes \\nto the cell.115 Whether lymphatic-mediated cholesterol \\nmobilization represents a significant plaque stabilizing or \\nregression-inducing pathway in humans is unknown.159\\nDIABETES MELLITUS IMPAIRS PLAQUE \\nMACROPHAGE INFLAMMATION \\nRESOLUTION\\nDespite advances in therapies to reduce CVD risk, patients \\nwith diabetes mellitus have a 2- to 4-fold higher risk of \\nASCVD and associated morbidity and mortality.66,160,161 \\nNotably, diabetes mellitus not only increases CVD events \\nbut also impairs the resolution or regression of ASCVD.161 \\nConsistent with the clinical data, diabetic mice have \\nimpaired atherosclerosis regression, as measured by the \\nquantity and inflammatory state of plaque macrophages \\nafter aggressive lipid lowering.103,104,162,163 Diabetes mel-\\nlitus in mice also increases monocytosis by activation of \\nmyelopoiesis, enhancing monocyte infiltration and plaque \\nmacrophage content, and impairs the polarization of plaque \\nmacrophages to the M2 state despite lipid lowering.86,104,164 \\nRecently, we considered the outcome of raising functional \\nHDL in diabetic mice and established that HDL can over-\\ncome diabetes mellitus‚Äìmediated impairments to regres-\\nsion by promoting a plaque M2 macrophage phenotype \\nand suppressing aberrant myelopoiesis on lipid lower-\\ning.103,143 In the context of regression, we ascribe the ben-\\neficial effects of raising functional HDL to its cholesterol \\nefflux capacity and anti-inflammatory functions‚Äîpathways \\ndysregulated in both diabetic patients and mice.143\\nTHERAPEUTIC TARGETING OF PLAQUE \\nMACROPHAGES\\nEven with potent cholesterol reduction, many patients expe-\\nrience a major adverse cardiac event. This is highlighted \\nby data from the FOURIER trial (Further Cardiovascular \\nOutcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects \\nwith Elevated Risk), which demonstrate that patients with \\nASCVD randomized to a PCSK9 inhibitor (in conjunction \\nwith statin therapy) reached a median LDL-C of 30 mg/dL; \\n10% of all patients still experienced a cardiovascular event \\nduring a median follow-up of 26 months.165 These data, \\nalong with other trials, of potent LDL-C lowering, demon-\\nstrate that lowering cholesterol alone is not sufficient to \\ncompletely reduce ASCVD-associated morbidity and mor-\\ntality.70,166‚Äì170 While robust LDL-C lowering is maintained \\nwith PCSK9 inhibitors and may induce ASCVD regression, \\nthe degree of regression is limited.70 Residual inflammatory \\nrisk has emerged as a mechanism predisposing individuals \\nto cardiovascular events, which remains even after aggres-\\nsive LDL-C lowering therapies in humans.22,72,73 Addition-\\nally, even in mice, aggressive LDL-C lowering does not, in \\nmost cases, lead to the complete regression of lesions (eg, \\n74,143). Indeed, maximal plaque regression did not occur if a \\ndecrease in macrophage inflammation was prevented at \\nthe same time lipid levels were lowered.74 In combination \\nwith lipid lowering therapies, specific targeting of plaque \\nmacrophage-mediated inflammation may represent a \\nviable option to reduce residual inflammatory CVD risk in \\nhumans and accelerate plaque regression in both humans \\nand mice. Namely, therapies that reduce plaque macro-\\nphage content by promoting macrophage efferocytosis, \\nemigration, or polarization to a pro-resolving phenotype are \\nlikely to have beneficial clinical outcomes when coupled \\nwith optimal medical therapies.\\nATVB IN FOCUS - AL\\nBarrett\\b\\nMacrophages in Atherosclerosis Regression\\nArterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2020;40:20‚Äì33.

Further research is necessary \\nto identify gene-expression profiles and transcriptional \\nregulators of macrophage phenotype and function and rec-\\noncile how divergent plaque macrophage phenotypes (ie, \\nM1, M2, Mhem, Mox, M4, and Tremhi) contribute to ASCVD \\nstability. Currently, pro-resolving macrophages that partici-\\npate in efficient efferocytosis, tissue remodeling, migration, \\nand suppression of inflammatory processes are considered \\noptimal for atherosclerotic regression (Figure).

Their superiority in early detection, prognosis evaluation and classified diagnosis is becoming \\nirreplaceable. Nevertheless, they are still less explored. This study aimed to determine and validate the diagnostic and \\ntherapeutic values of differentially expressed immune-related genes (DE-IRGs) in CAD.\\nMethods:‚ÄÇ We downloaded clinical information and RNA sequence data from the GEO database. We used R software, \\nGO, KEGG and Cytoscape to analyze and visualize the data. A LASSO method was conducted to identify key genes \\nfor diagnostic model construction. The ssGSEA analysis was used to investigate the differential immune cell infiltra-\\ntion. Besides, we constructed CAD mouse model (low-density lipoprotein receptor deficient mice with high fat diet) \\nto discover the correlation between the screened genes and severe CAD progress. We further uncovered the role of \\nIL13RA1 might play in atherosclerosis.\\nResults:‚ÄÇ A total of 762 differential genes were identified between the peripheral blood of 218 controls and 199 CAD \\npatients, which were significantly associated with infection, immune response and neural activity. 58 DE-IRGs were \\nobtained by overlapping the differentially expressed genes(DEGs) and immune-related genes downloaded from \\nImmpDb database. Through LASSO regression, CCR9, CER1, CSF2, IL13RA1, INSL5, MBL2, MMP9, MSR1, NTS, TNFRSF19, \\nCXCL2, HTR3C, IL1A, and NR4A2 were distinguished as peripheral biomarkers of CAD with eligible diagnostic capa-\\nbilities in the training set (AUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.968) and test set (AUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.859). The ssGSEA analysis showed that the peripheral \\nimmune cells had characteristic distribution in CAD and also close relationship with specific DE-IRGs. RT-qPCR test \\nshowed that CCR9, CSF2, IL13RA1, and NTS had a significant correlation with ¬≠LDLR‚àí/‚àí mice. IL13RA1 knocked down \\nin RAW264.7 cell lines decreased SCARB1 and ox-LDL-stimulated CD36 mRNA expression, TGF-Œ≤, VEGF-C and Œ±-SMA \\nprotein levels and increased the production of IL-6, with downregulation of JAK1/STAT3 signal pathway.\\nConclusions:‚ÄÇ We constructed a diagnostic model of advanced-stage CAD based on the screened 14 DE-IRGs. We \\nverified 4 genes of them to have a strong correlation with CAD, and IL13RA1 might participate in the inflammation, \\nfibrosis, and cholesterol efflux process of atherosclerosis by regulating JAK1/STAT3 pathway.\\nKeywords:‚ÄÇ Coronary atherosclerotic disease, Immune-related genes, Peripheral blood, Inflammation, Immune cells\\n¬© The Author(s) 2022.

In 2017, CAD indepen-\\ndently resulted in about 18 million deaths globally [2], \\nand by 2030 as predicted, the number would reach 23.4 \\nmillion [3]. Situations are becoming even worse under \\nOpen Access\\nJournal of \\nTranslational Medicine\\n*Correspondence:  liuping0207@yeah.net\\nDepartment of¬†Cardiology, Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University \\nof¬†Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China\\nPage 2 of 17\\nFeng¬†et¬†al. Journal of Translational Medicine          (2022) 20:399 \\nthe context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Atherosclerotic \\nlesions always result in progressive coronary stenosis, \\nmyocardial ischemia, necrosis and eventually the cumu-\\nlative risk of acute cardiovascular syndrome (ACS). This \\nprocess may last for decades. In the long course, patients \\nusually experience peripheral blood immune component \\nchanges [4], which are related to the acute exacerbation, \\nremission and stability of the disease. Therefore, they can \\nalso serve as biomarkers for disease monitoring or as tar-\\ngets for treatment. Effectively identification of them and \\nsubsequent mechanism exploration are critical for the \\nsecondary prevention of CAD.\\nEvidence accumulated in the past 20¬†years has shown \\nthat immune disorders played decisive roles in the initia-\\ntion and development of the CAD pathology process [5]. \\nSome immune changes have already existed before the \\npathological phenomenon occurs [6]. Previous bioinfor-\\nmatic studies had extensively analyzed a vast amount of \\nmicroarray data involving CAD from online databases to \\nlaboratory experiments. Their results showed that many \\nperipheral immune genes of CAD patients had signifi-\\ncant changes compared with the control groups, includ-\\ning but not limited to CXCL8, TNF, SOCS3, TNFAIP3, \\nCD86, C1QB, CD53, C1QC, NCF2, ITGAM, MAPK1, \\nMAPK3, MAPK13, MAPK14, JUN, CHUK, PIK3CB, \\nTLR4, IFNAR1, TLR2, MYD88, IRAK4, CSF3, IL-1A, \\nCCR7 and IL-18 [7‚Äì10]. However, these projects‚Äô cur-\\nrent sample scale and scope are still limited. Besides, \\nfew of the screened novel targets got effectively valida-\\ntion or further mechanism exploration, which dramati-\\ncally restrained their translation to the clinic. Therefore, \\nalthough we have mastered some convincible evidence, \\nthe peripheral immune characteristics and mechanism of \\nCAD still need to be further uncovered.\\nIn this study, we constructed a novel monitoring diag-\\nnostic model of advanced-stage CAD with the screened \\nkey differentially expressed immune-related genes (DE-\\nIRGs) in the database. We used low-density lipoprotein \\nreceptor deficient ¬≠(LDLR‚àí/‚àí) mice (a typical CAD animal \\nmodel) to determine the correlation between the can-\\ndidate genes and CAD. Finally, we found that IL13RA1 \\nprobably participated in various pathological processes of \\nCAD, which showed a strong potential to be a diagnostic \\nand therapeutic target.\\nMaterials and¬†methods\\nData preparation\\nThe mRNA expression data in the peripheral blood \\nwere derived from the Gene Expression Omnibus \\n(GEO;‚ÄÇ https://‚Äãwww.‚Äãncbi.‚Äãnlm.‚Äãnih.‚Äãgov/‚Äãgeo/‚Äãquery/‚Äãacc.‚Äã\\ncgi) based on the criteria below: organism (homo sapi-\\nens), experiment type (expression profiling by array), \\ndisease (CAD). In this study, we eventually obtained \\nthree datasets (see corresponding clinical and demog-\\nraphy information in Additional file¬† 1: Table¬† S1). The \\nGSE20680 dataset involved 87 CAD patients (more \\nthan 1 large artery stenosis ‚â• 70% or 2 artery steno-\\nsis ‚â• 50%) and 108 controls(artery stenosis‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ25%, or \\nstenosis‚Äâ>‚Äâ25%, but‚Äâ<‚Äâ50%) on the platform of GPL4133 \\n[11]. The GSE20681 dataset included 99 CAD patients \\n(more than 1 main blood vessel‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ50% stenosis) and 99 \\ncontrols(stenosis‚Äâ<‚Äâ50%) on the platform of GPL4133 \\n[12]. The GSE42148 was composed of 13 CAD patients \\n(diagnosed as CAD patient by Quantitative Coronary \\nAngiography, QCA) and 11 controls (with normal ECG \\nand no clinical symptom) based on the platform of \\nGPL13607[13]. All the data from the three datasets were \\nre-normalized by ComBat algorithm (Fig.¬† 1) to remove \\nthe batch effect, and evaluated by principal component \\nanalysis (PCA). All the CAD group patients received \\nQCA evaluation, and satisfied at least 1 main blood ves-\\nsel stenosis‚â•50%; relative healthy control group was in \\naccordance with all the vessels stenosis‚Äâ<‚Äâ50% or without \\nECG change and clinical symptom.\\nAll the CAD patients and controls from the three data-\\nsets were randomly but evenly divided into the training \\nset and test set (1:1), respectively. The two sets have the \\nsame number and proportion of CAD patients and rela-\\ntively healthy people.\\nIdentification of¬†differentially expressed genes (DEGs)\\nBased on the combined datasets, we used the LIMMA \\npackage to screen DEGs between CAD and control \\ngroups with the cutoff of |fold change (FC)|>‚Äâ0.2 and \\nadjusted p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05. Then we visualized them by volcano \\nand heat maps [14].\\nIdentification of¬†key immune‚Äërelated genes (IRGs)\\nWe obtained IRGs from Immport database (ImmpDb; \\nhttps://‚Äãwww.‚Äãimmpo‚Äãrt.‚Äãorg/). The IRGs (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ1793) found \\nin the datasets were overlapped with the DEGs (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ762), \\nand the overlapped part was regarded as CAD progres-\\nsion immune-related genes for the subsequent analysis.\\nProtein‚Äìprotein interaction (PPI) network construction, \\ngene ontology (GO) analysis and¬†KEGG pathway \\nenrichment analysis\\nThe interactions between specified proteins were ana-\\nlyzed via the STRING online tool (http://‚Äãstring-‚Äãdb.‚Äãorg/) \\n[15]. To confirm the effectiveness of this interaction, we \\nlimited confidence (combined score)‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.7. To further \\nexplore the underlying biological pathways associated \\nwith the identified DEGs, we performed the GO analysis \\nand KEGG pathway enrichment analysis using Cluster-\\nProfiler package [16].\\nPage 3 of 17\\nFeng¬†et¬†al. Journal of Translational Medicine          (2022) 20:399 \\n\\t\\nImmune cell subgroups analysis\\nTo better recognize the immune cell characteristics in \\nperipheral blood of relative healthy people and CAD \\npatients, we compared the differences of immune cell \\nsubsets in the samples. We used the single sample gene \\nset enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) to compare the differ-\\nential composition of 28 immune cells between the two \\ngroups [17]. The Pearson correlation analysis was used \\nto reveal the correlation between the distribution of \\nimmune cells and the expression of the DE-IRGs.\\nEstablishment and¬†assessment of¬†the¬†immune‚Äëbased \\ndiagnostic model\\nBy feature selection, we reduced the dimension through \\nthe least absolute shrinkage and selection operator \\n(LASSO) regression algorithms [18] and determined 14 \\nIRGs to construct the diagnostic monitoring model of \\nCAD. Then we conducted receiver operating character-\\nistic (ROC) curves of the 14 biomarkers based on the \\ntraining set and test set, and measure the area under the \\ncurve to evaluate the diagnostic capacity (area under \\ncurve, AUC) of different genes by R software. Similarly, \\nwe evaluated the diagnostic power of the combined 14 \\nDE-IRGs by ROC analysis in the training set and test set, \\nrespectively.\\nCell lines culture\\nRAW264.7 cells were purchased from the cell bank of \\ntypical culture preservation Committee of Chinese Acad-\\nemy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and cultivated in high-\\nglucose Dulbecco‚Äôs modified Eagle‚Äôs medium (DMEM, \\nCytiva, HyClone Laboratories, United states) with 10% \\nfetal bovine serum (FBS, Procell Life Science & Technol-\\nogy Co., Ltd., China) and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomy-\\ncin at 37 ‚ÑÉ and 5% ¬≠CO2.\\nBone marrow‚Äëderived macrophages (BMDMs) harvest\\nFemur and tibia of C57/B6J(6-week old, male) were \\nflushed with 1¬†mL of Modified Eagle‚Äôs medium(Œ±-MEM, \\nGbico, United states) with 10% FBS and 100 U/ml peni-\\ncillin/streptomycin to obtain bone marrow cells.

All \\nthe experiments were independently repeated at least \\n3¬†times.\\nResults\\nIdentification of¬†differential mRNA expression in¬†peripheral \\nblood\\nThe peripheral blood transcriptome of 199 CAD patients \\nand 218 controls was involved in this study. PCA \\nanalysis revealed that the batch effect was efficiently \\nremoved across the three gene sets (Fig.¬†2A, B). A total \\nof 762 DEGs were identified, of which 396 genes were \\nup-regulated, while 366 genes were down-regulated \\n(Fig.¬†2C). The top five up-regulated genes were C17orf78, \\nTTTY21, TMEM213, COL21A1, and SNX31, while the \\ntop five down-regulated genes included EGR3, TTTY7, \\nTMEM196, DNAJC28, and OLR1. The heat map showed \\nthe genes with |logFC|>‚Äâ0.2 between CAD patients and \\ncontrols, suggesting they were likely to participate in the \\npathological process of CAD (Fig.¬†2D).\\nFunctional enrichment analysis for¬†DEGs\\nTo explore the relationship between these DEGs and the \\nbiological functions involved in the regulation process, we \\nconstructed protein‚Äìprotein interaction (PPI) network. \\nPPI analysis revealed that these genes have strong connec-\\ntions at the protein level (Fig.¬†3A). GO analysis revealed \\nthe profile of the DEGs involved in molecular function, \\nbiological process, and cellular component, respectively, \\nsuch as receptor-ligand activity, transporter complex and \\ncellular process (Fig.¬† 3B). The KEGG pathway enrich-\\nment plot showed that the main enriched pathways were \\ncytokine-cytokine \\nreceptor \\ninteraction, \\nneuroactive \\nligand-receptor interaction, and IL-17 signaling pathway, \\nindicating a strong correlation with the functions related \\nto inflammation response and neural activity (Fig.¬†3C).\\nDE‚ÄëIRGs determination and¬†immune‚Äërelated cell landscape \\nanalysis\\nThe above DEGs in CAD patients were overlapped with \\nthe IRGs. 58 DE-IRGs in CAD patients were determined \\n(Fig.¬† 4A). Meanwhile, the proportion of seven kinds of \\nimmune cell subsets in these chips was found different \\nfrom CAD to control group. Among them, the propor-\\ntion of activated dendritic cells, mast cells, neutrophils, \\nTh17 cells and MDSC in CAD increased(P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05), while \\nthe proportion of activated B cells and CD56 killer cells \\ndecreased (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05)(Fig.¬†4B, C). Additionally, there were \\ncorrelations between the changed peripheral immune \\ncells (Fig.¬† 4D), such as activated ¬≠CD4+ T cell/Th2 \\ncell(r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.62), macrophage/mast cell(r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.55), and neu-\\ntrophil/plasmacytoid dendritic cell(r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.62).\\nIdentification of¬†14 key peripheral DE‚ÄëIRGs of¬†CAD \\nand¬†construction of¬†an¬†immune diagnostic model\\nWe reduced the dimensions through LASSO regres-\\nsion and eventually determined 14 genes to con-\\nstruct a diagnostic model of CAD (Fig.¬† 5A, B). The \\ndiagnostic performance of the identified 14 key periph-\\neral DE-IRGs was evaluated by ROC curves. The areas \\nunder ROC curves were CCR9 (AUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.686), CER1 \\n(AUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.604), CSF2 (AUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.688), CXCL2 (AUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.589), \\nHTR3C (AUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.699), IL13RA1 (AUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.650), IL1A \\n(AUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.667), INSL5 (AUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.624), MBL2 (AUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.619), \\nMMP9 (AUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.649), MSR1(AUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.679), NR4RA2 \\n(AUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.657),‚ÄÇ NTS(AUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.667)‚ÄÇ and‚ÄÇ TNFRSF19 \\n(AUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.686) (Fig.¬† 5C, D), respectively. However, when \\nall the 14 genes were contained in one diagnostic model, \\nthe AUC in the training dataset and test dataset reached \\n0.968 and 0.859, respectively (Fig.¬†5E, F). The result proved \\nthat these combined DE-IRGs had good potential for diag-\\nnosis and might also become promising prevention and \\ntreatment targets of CAD.\\nPage 6 of 17\\nFeng¬†et¬†al. Journal of Translational Medicine          (2022) 20:399 \\nPeripheral immune characteristics analysis of¬†CAD patients\\n14 key peripheral DE-IRGs showed significant change \\nbetween CAD and control groups.

The average weight of the CAD model \\ngroup increased sharply than control group (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.0001) \\n(Fig.¬†7B). Meanwhile, the peripheral circulating low-den-\\nsity lipoprotein(LDL) and triglyceride (TRIG) levels in \\nthe CAD group are high increased (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.0001) (Fig.¬†7C, \\nD). The detection of whole blood total mRNAs showed \\nthat CCR9, CSF2, IL13RA1 and NTS expression in the \\nCAD model group were significantly higher than those \\nin the control group (Fig.¬† 7E‚ÄìH, M) (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05), which \\ndemonstrated the same trend as those online screened \\nresults from the datasets. IL1A, has also been raised in \\nthe model group(P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01), showing an opposite tendency \\nto the results of the online data (Fig.¬†7I). However, no dif-\\nference between the two groups was found in CXCL2, \\nINSL5, MSR1, NR4A2, and TNFRSF19(P‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.05)(Fig.¬†7G, \\nJ‚ÄìL, N).\\nIL13RA1 activating JAK1/STAT3 pathway and¬†regulating \\nthe¬†function of¬†macrophage in¬†CAD\\nIn vitro, ox-LDL up-regulated the IL13RA1 mRNA \\nexpression(P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01), activated JAK1/STAT3 signaling \\npathway(P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05, P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01) and also increased the pro-\\nduction of VEGF-C in BMDMs(P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01) (Fig.¬†8A, B‚ÄìE). \\nIn¬† vivo, similarly, in the aortas of 20-week-HFD-diet-\\ninduced ¬≠LDL‚àí/‚àí mice(CAD mouse model), IL13RA1 \\nmRNA expression, phosphate-JAK1, phosphate-STAT3, \\nVEGF-C and IL-6 protein level increased(P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01, \\nP‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001)(Fig.¬† 8C, D‚ÄìF). After transfecting siRNA into \\nRAW264.7 cells (Fig.¬† 8G), IL13RA1 mRNA expression \\nwas significantly knocked down(P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001) (Fig.¬† 8H), \\nwhich resulted in downregulation of the phospho-\\nrylation levels of JAK1 and STAT3, VEGFC, TGF-Œ≤ \\nand Œ±-SMA(P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05, P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01)(Fig.¬† 8I, J). The IL13RA1 \\nknockdown groups also had decreased SCARB1 and ox-\\nLDL-stimulated CD36 mRNA levels(P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001, P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01)\\n(Fig.¬† 8M, N). Interestingly, the knockdown of IL13RA1 \\nincreased the IL-6 production(P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.0001)(Fig.¬† 8I, J). \\nUnder the stimulation of ox-LDL, the above chang-\\ning trend was consistent and more obvious.

At first, it \\nmay be due to some minor vascular abnormalities. Over \\ntime, it develops and deteriorates over several years to \\ndecades and finally reaches a life-threatening level. In this \\nlong process, many pathophysiological factors affect the \\noutcome of the disease. For over one century, it has been \\nbelieved that circulating lipid disorder was the key cause \\ninducing atherosclerosis-based cardiovascular disease. \\n20¬†years ago, Professor Peter Libby put forward the view \\nthat inflammation participated in atherosclerosis, which \\ntriggered a heated discussion on immune-mediated CAD \\nand was confirmed by several subsequent studies [19]. \\nToday, no one doubts that the immune system impacts \\nthe entire process of CAD [20, 21]. In this context, an \\nimportant method for CAD immunology research is \\nto continuously screen out new differential diagnos-\\ntic targets through omics and bioinformatics research, \\nsubsequently explore mechanisms through animal exper-\\niments, or verify reliability in large clinical trials.\\nFollowing this line, we obtained high-throughput \\nmRNA data from 199 CAD patients and 218 relative \\nhealthy people samples online, then screened 14 DE-\\nIRGs in the peripheral blood from CAD patients to \\nestablish a CAD diagnosis model. Among them, CCR9, \\nCER1, CSF2, IL13RA1, INSL5, MBL2, MMP9, MSR1, \\nNTS and TNFRSF19 were highly expressed, while \\nCXCL2, HTR3C, IL1A and NR4A2 gene were low. CCR9, \\nCSF2, IL13RA1 and NTS were validated by the RT-qPCR \\ntest and IL13RA1 was further discovered that affect the \\nCAD progression by regulating ox-LDL-stimulated mac-\\nrophage function.\\nGO enrichment analysis showed that the differential \\ngenes were mainly concentrated in cell proliferation, \\nintercellular communication and mutual regulation, cell \\nadhesion and migration (Fig.¬†3B). KEGG pathway enrich-\\nment analysis suggested that cytokine-cytokine recep-\\ntor interaction, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction \\nand IL-17 signaling pathway were significantly enriched \\n(Fig.¬†3C). Notably, the enrichment of cytokine-cytokine \\nreceptor interaction and IL-17 signaling pathway in \\nCAD has been reported in another independent research \\nbefore [8]. Our results reaffirmed that these two pathways \\nhad a strong connection to CAD, revealing that continu-\\nous attention should be taken. Moreover, the enrichment \\nassociated with neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction \\nPage 10 of 17\\nFeng¬†et¬†al. Journal of Translational Medicine          (2022) 20:399 \\nindicated simultaneous neurodegenerative changes (such \\nas Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and Parkinson‚Äôs syndrome) might \\noccur in the CAD patients involved in this study. The \\neffect of statins or other therapies may also be involved in \\nthe above changes [22].\\nWith the development of single-cell sequencing tech-\\nnology [23, 24], the description and recognition for the \\nimmune system‚Äôs participation in the CAD is becom-\\ning vivid abundant. Online re-analysing the distribution \\ncharacteristics of immune cell subsets is therefore reveal-\\ning enormous value [25]. In atherosclerotic plaque, many \\ncirculating immune cells with chemotaxis participate in \\nendothelial injury and lipid infiltration [26]. Our results \\nshowed that the number of mast cells, neutrophils, acti-\\nvated dendritic cells, MDSC, and type 17¬†T helper cells \\nin the CAD group have increased (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). The neutro-\\nphil is a crucial cell to promote the progress of athero-\\nsclerosis. It can increase the area and instability of plaque \\nby releasing a variety of cytokines and adhesion factors \\n[27], and would also promote macrophage phagocytosis \\nof lipids and MMP-9 level [28, 29]. In our investigation, \\nneutrophils in patients with CAD were strongly asso-\\nciated with the increased expression of IL13RA1 and \\nMMP-9 (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01). Dendritic cells proliferated and acti-\\nvated in the presence of GM-CSF produced by endothe-\\nlial cells [30], and might participate in immune signal \\ntransmission in the process of CAD. Generally, B1 lym-\\nphocytes were considered to have a solid ability to resist \\natherosclerosis plaque formation and play an essential \\nrole in reducing foam cells [31]. In this study, we found \\nthe number of activated B cells was reduced compared \\nwith those in the healthy group (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). Natural killer \\ncell absence resulted in elevated serum cholesterol levels \\nand increased plaque area in mice according to a pre-\\nvious study [32]. In this study, mature killing-capable \\n(CD56dim) natural killer cells of the CAD group showed \\na downward trend (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). However, although dif-\\nferentially expressed in this study, the role of mast cells, \\nMDSC, and type 17¬† T helper cells in CAD is still not \\nclear enough.\\nMacrophage scavenger receptor 1(MSR1) and nuclear \\nreceptor subfamily 4 group A member 2(NR4A2) have been \\nreported to play a protective role in CAD. MSR1 inhibits \\nTNFs by promoting the expression of IL-10Œ±expression to \\nregulate immunity, which is beneficial to the stability and \\nregression of AS and myocardial repair after infarction [33]. \\nNR4A2 is a transcription factor to protect cardiomyocytes \\nby transcriptionally inhibiting CCR5 and promoting mac-\\nrophage polarization to M2 type [34], therefore seemed to \\nplay a positive role in anti-inflammation.\\nColony-stimulating \\nfactor \\n2(CSF2), \\nC‚ÄìC \\nmotif \\nchemokine receptor 9(CCR9), matrix metallopeptidase \\n9(MMP9) and neurotensin (NTS) seem to exacerbate the \\nprogress of CAD. CSF2 expresses granulocyte colony-\\nstimulating factor (GM-CSF), GM-CSF plays a critical \\nrole in promoting the transformation from circulatory \\nmonocytes to local macrophages. Recent research has \\nreported that it leads to the susceptibility of macrophages \\nto apoptosis by mediating IL-23 activated oxidation path-\\nway, which results in plaque progression in advanced ath-\\nerosclerosis [35]. The CCR9 was previously reported to \\nbe related to the process of inflammatory expression and \\nmyocardial remodeling after myocardial infarction. After \\nthe gene was knocked out, it reduced cardiac-related \\ninflammatory factors such as IL-6 and IL-1Œ≤, TNF-Œ± and \\nso on, which may be mainly through NF-Œ∫B and MAPK \\nsignaling pathways to regulate the production of myocar-\\ndial hypertrophy [36]. MMP9 regulation is closely related \\nto multiple signaling ways of cardiovascular disease, \\natherosclerotic plaque instability, and myocardial tis-\\nsue repair after infarction. Previous studies have already \\nshown that the change of MMP9 level in circulation is an \\nindependent predictor of atherosclerosis [37]. Circulating \\nNTS is a previously reported risk factor for cardiovascu-\\nlar disease. Its up-regulation increased the risk of type I \\ndiabetes and multiple atherosclerotic diseases by pro-\\nmoting lipid absorption [38].\\nMannose-binding \\nlectin \\n2(MBL2), \\nC-X-C \\nmotif \\nchemokine ligand 2(CXCL2), interleukin 1Œ± (IL-1A) and \\nTNF receptor superfamily member 19(TNFRSF19) only \\nshowed a correlation with CAD. Previous studies have \\nshown that MBL2 is highly expressed in peripheral blood \\nof patients with CAD [39], related to various heart risks, \\nand has led to the critical value of early diagnosis. CXCL2 \\nand IL-1Œ±were also found up-regulated in the athero-\\nsclerotic mouse model [40, 41]. However, CXCL2 had \\nno significant difference in our animal validation, while \\nup-regulation of IL-1A was displayed in the CAD group, \\nwhich is opposite to the dataset analysis result. The prob-\\nable causes of the bias might include the different baseline \\n(See figure on next page.)\\nFig.‚ÄØ5‚ÄÇ Establishment and test of the 14-gene diagnosis model.

Previous studies have \\nreported the increased expression of TNFRSF19 in CAD \\n[42], but these studies were very preliminary.\\nFurthermore, \\n5-hydroxytryptamine \\nreceptor \\n3C \\n(HTR3C), cerberus 1(CER1) and insulin-like 5(INSL5) \\nwere screened out for the 1st¬†time and might have the \\npotential to participate in the CAD process. As far as \\nwe know, they have never been reported to be directly \\nrelated to CAD before, but some have been confirmed to \\naffect the changes of immune targets in circulation. For \\nexample, INSL5, as a peptide hormone, after intraperito-\\nneal injection, leads to significant changes in inflamma-\\ntory factors such as IL-5, IL-7, M-CSF, IL-15 and IL-27 \\n[43], and these inflammatory signals typically play a reg-\\nulatory role in CAD. However, more direct evidence is \\nneeded to explore the causal relationship between them \\nand CAD.\\nThe detection of biomarkers in peripheral blood is sim-\\npler and faster than invasive methods, which is suitable \\nfor a wide range of community risk screening and timely \\nprogression assessment. Based on this, we constructed a \\nperipheral immune diagnosis model with the 14 screened \\ngenes, which showed good diagnostic efficiency in the \\ndiagnostic tests of the training set (AUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.968) and \\ntest set (AUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.859). In addition, four related candi-\\ndate genes CCR9 (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.0001), CSF2 (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05), IL13RA1 \\n(P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.0001) and NTS (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01) (Fig.¬† 7E, F‚ÄìH‚ÄìM) were \\nobtained in the in-vivo correlation verification of 10 novel \\ntargets. Among them, IL13RA1 shows a strong relevance \\n(P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.0001), and belongs to one of the receptors involved \\nin the main enrichment signal pathway cytokine-cytokine \\nreceptor interaction (Fig.¬†3C), which is also significantly \\nrelated to the distribution of macrophages (Fig.¬†6C). We \\nexplored its role in macrophages in¬†vitro.\\nInterleukin 13 receptor Œ±1(IL13RŒ±1), connected with \\ninterleukin 4 receiver Œ±1(IL4Œ±1), forms a receptor com-\\nplex, which is the main receptor of interleukin 13 (IL-13) \\nand interleukin (IL-4). It triggers phosphorylation activa-\\ntion of downstream JAK1, STAT3, and STAT6, and regu-\\nlates cell proliferation and migration activities. As a main \\nsignal of the macrophage alternative activation pathway, \\nIL13RA1 participate in releasing IL-10 and TGF- Œ≤ to \\ninhibit the inflammatory response and strengthen the \\nphagocytosis and migration of macrophages [44], there-\\nfore it is speculated to play a positive role in CAD. How-\\never, the direct evidence of IL13RA1 affecting CAD is \\nstill limited. Although it is generally believed that M2 \\nmacrophages help reduce inflammation in atherosclero-\\nsis, thus alleviating the development of CAD, there is also \\nevidence that M2 macrophages formed in the early stage \\nof AS are more likely to ingest cholesterol and form foam \\ncells [45]. Meanwhile, under the induction of typical pro-\\ninflammatory factors, they are more likely to transform \\ninto M1 macrophages than the unpolarized ones [46, 47]. \\nIn this study, IL13RA1 mRNA expression in aortic arch \\nsamples of HFD-fed ¬≠LDLR‚àí/‚àí mice was significantly \\nup-regulated. Consistently, under ox-LDL stimulation, \\nIL13RA1 mRNA expression in BMDMs showed the same \\ntrend. JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway was activated both \\nin¬†vivo and in¬†vitro, suggesting that the IL13RA1/JAK1/\\nSTAT3 may be involved in the formation of CAD lesions.\\nWe assumed that IL13RA1 played a negative role \\nin CAD. The expression of IL13RA1 in macrophages \\nwas interfered with by using small interfering RNA (si-\\nIL13RA1). The results showed that IL13RA1 knockdown \\nmacrophages reduced lipid uptake under the stimula-\\ntion of ox-LDL (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). When ox-LDL was not added, \\nno difference in the activation of JAK1/STAT3 between \\nthe two groups occurred, but after ox-LDL was added, \\nthe phosphorylation ratio of the two groups was sig-\\nnificantly up-regulated. The up-regulation range of the \\nknockdown(si-IL13RA1‚Äâ+‚Äâox-LDL) group was signifi-\\ncantly lower than that of the negative control(si-nc‚Äâ+‚Äâox-\\nLDL) group (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001, P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). Regardless with/without \\nthe stimulation of ox-LDL, in the IL13RA1 knockdown \\ngroup, TGF-Œ≤ and Œ±- SMA expression both decreased \\n(P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01). However, the decrease of VEGF-C expression \\nonly occurred in the IL13RA1 knockdown group with-\\nout ox-LDL induction. (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). These results show that \\nthe reduced expression of IL13RA1 leads to the reduced \\npotential of macrophages to resist inflammation and \\npromote fibrosis. Furthermore, regardless with/without \\nox-LDL induction, the expression of IL-6 was remark-\\nably up-regulated by IL13RA1 knockdown (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.0001, \\nP‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001), suggesting that the deletion of IL13RA1 \\naggravated the inflammatory response of macrophages. \\nBesides, under the stimulation of ox-LDL, the knock-\\ndown of IL13RA1 revealed lower expression of SCARB1 \\n(SR-B1) and CD36 mRNA levels (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001, P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01). \\nFig.‚ÄØ6‚ÄÇ Immune characteristics of peripheral blood in patients with CAD.

Journal of Translational Medicine          (2022) 20:399 \\nSince these two kinds of receptors mediate cholesterol \\nefflux and cholesterol uptake in macrophages, respec-\\ntively, proving that the presence of IL13RA1 enhances \\nthe fluidity of cholesterol inside and outside mac-\\nrophages. However, from the results of our experiments, \\nthe deletion of IL13RA1 finally led to more lipid uptake \\nby macrophages.\\nThus, IL13RA1 seems to play multiple roles in CAD. \\nOn the one hand, it may promote the expression of CD36, \\nactivates JAK1/STAT3, strengthens the lipid loading of \\nmacrophages, and accelerates the formation of foam \\ncells; On the other hand, it can also reduce the inflam-\\nmatory response by promoting the TGF-Œ≤ and inhibit-\\ning IL-6, promotes the formation of plaque fibrous cap \\nby increasing Œ±-SMA, and enhances cholesterol efflux by \\nup-regulating SR-B1. In addition, IL13RA1 also promotes \\nthe production of VEGF-C, which is believed to acceler-\\nate the process of plaque inflammation and lipid accu-\\nmulation by promoting the formation of pathological \\nlymphatics in the early stage of atherosclerosis [48], and \\nalso plays an active role in plaque regression and cardiac \\nfunction recovery in the later stage [49].\\nConclusion\\nCCR9, CER1, CSF2, IL13RA1, INSL5, MBL2, MMP9, \\nMSR1, NTS, TNFRSF19, CXCL2, HTR3C, IL1A, and \\nNR4A2 are the differentially expressed immune-\\nrelated genes of CAD that we screened from online \\ndatasets.

      "# The Role of Inflammation in the Pathogenesis of Atherosclerosis and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "Atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD) are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Both conditions are characterized by the buildup of plaques within the arterial wall, leading to reduced blood flow and potential infarction. Recent research has underscored the significant role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of these diseases. This document examines the role of inflammation in the development of atherosclerosis and CAD, elucidating key inflammatory pathways, immune cell involvement, and potential therapeutic targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Methodology\n",
      "A comprehensive review of current literature was conducted, focusing on inflammatory processes in atherosclerosis and CAD. The search included peer-reviewed articles from PubMed. Keywords used included \"inflammation,\" \"atherosclerosis,\" \"coronary artery disease,\" \"immune response,\" and \"inflammatory markers.\" Data were synthesized from multiple sources to present a cohesive understanding of the inflammation-atherogenesis link, immune cell dynamics, and therapeutic interventions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Results\n",
      "### Inflammatory Pathways in Atherosclerosis\n",
      "Inflammation is a critical player in all stages of atherosclerosis, from initiation to plaque rupture. The process begins with endothelial dysfunction, often caused by risk factors like hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and smoking. Endothelial cells respond to these insults by expressing adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) that recruit immune cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Key Players:\n",
      "1. **Lipoproteins and Oxidative Stress**: \n",
      "   - LDL particles can penetrate the endothelium and become oxidized (oxLDL).\n",
      "   - OxLDL is recognized by scavenger receptors on macrophages, leading to foam cell formation and plaque development.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Cytokines and Chemokines**:\n",
      "   - Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1Œ≤, TNF-Œ±, IL-6) are released by endothelial cells, macrophages, and T cells, perpetuating a local inflammatory response.\n",
      "   - Chemokines like MCP-1 recruit monocytes to the site of inflammation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Macrophages and T Cells**:\n",
      "   - Monocytes differentiate into macrophages that ingest lipids, becoming foam cells.\n",
      "   - T cells secrete cytokines, enhancing the inflammatory response and modulating macrophage activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Immune Cell Dynamics\n",
      "Macrophages play a central role in atherosclerosis, contributing to plaque development and stability. Studies show that different macrophage phenotypes (M1 and M2) have distinct roles:\n",
      "- **M1 Macrophages**: Pro-inflammatory, contributing to plaque instability.\n",
      "- **M2 Macrophages**: Anti-inflammatory, involved in tissue repair but also in foam cell formation under certain conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent studies have identified other immune cells, such as B cells, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, in the atherosclerotic plaques, each contributing to the disease's progression in unique ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Diagnostic Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets\n",
      "#### Biomarkers:\n",
      "1. **C-reactive Protein (CRP)**: A marker of systemic inflammation correlated with CAD severity.\n",
      "2. **IL-6 and IL-1Œ≤**: Elevated levels are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Therapeutic Targets:\n",
      "1. **Statins**: Beyond lipid-lowering, they reduce inflammation.\n",
      "2. **PCSK9 Inhibitors**: Lower LDL levels and inflammatory markers.\n",
      "3. **Monoclonal Antibodies**:\n",
      "   - Canakinumab (IL-1Œ≤ inhibitor) has shown promise in reducing recurrent cardiovascular events.\n",
      "   - Tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor blocker) is under investigation for atherosclerosis management.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Discussion\n",
      "The intricate interplay between inflammation and atherosclerosis provides numerous entry points for therapeutic intervention. Managing inflammation through lifestyle modifications and pharmacotherapy can significantly reduce the risk and severity of CAD. The success of anti-inflammatory treatments highlights the potential for targeting specific inflammatory pathways to improve cardiovascular outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Limitations of Current Research\n",
      "While advancements have been made in understanding the role of inflammation in atherosclerosis, there remain challenges:\n",
      "1. **Heterogeneity in Patient Response**: Variability in genetic and environmental factors influences treatment efficacy.\n",
      "2. **Complexity of Inflammatory Pathways**: Redundant and compensatory pathways complicate targeted therapies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further research is needed to develop personalized therapeutic strategies and to identify additional biomarkers for better disease prediction and management.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "Inflammation is crucial in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and CAD. The identification of key inflammatory pathways and immune cells involved in plaque development and instability opens new avenues for diagnosis and treatment. The integration of anti-inflammatory strategies into current treatment protocols holds promise for reducing the burden of cardiovascular diseases.\n",

      "# The Role of Inflammation in the Pathogenesis of Atherosclerosis and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "Atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD) are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Both conditions are characterized by the buildup of plaques within the arterial wall, leading to reduced blood flow and potential infarction. Recent research has underscored the significant role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of these diseases. This document examines the role of inflammation in the development of atherosclerosis and CAD, elucidating key inflammatory pathways, immune cell involvement, and potential therapeutic targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Methodology\n",
      "A comprehensive review of current literature was conducted, focusing on inflammatory processes in atherosclerosis and CAD. The search included peer-reviewed articles from PubMed. Keywords used included \"inflammation,\" \"atherosclerosis,\" \"coronary artery disease,\" \"immune response,\" and \"inflammatory markers.\" Data were synthesized from multiple sources to present a cohesive understanding of the inflammation-atherogenesis link, immune cell dynamics, and therapeutic interventions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Results\n",
      "### Inflammatory Pathways in Atherosclerosis\n",
      "Inflammation is a critical player in all stages of atherosclerosis, from initiation to plaque rupture. The process begins with endothelial dysfunction, often caused by risk factors like hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and smoking. Endothelial cells respond to these insults by expressing adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) that recruit immune cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Key Players:\n",
      "1. **Lipoproteins and Oxidative Stress**: \n",
      "   - LDL particles can penetrate the endothelium and become oxidized (oxLDL).\n",
      "   - OxLDL is recognized by scavenger receptors on macrophages, leading to foam cell formation and plaque development.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Cytokines and Chemokines**:\n",
      "   - Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1Œ≤, TNF-Œ±, IL-6) are released by endothelial cells, macrophages, and T cells, perpetuating a local inflammatory response.\n",
      "   - Chemokines like MCP-1 recruit monocytes to the site of inflammation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Macrophages and T Cells**:\n",
      "   - Monocytes differentiate into macrophages that ingest lipids, becoming foam cells.\n",
      "   - T cells secrete cytokines, enhancing the inflammatory response and modulating macrophage activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Immune Cell Dynamics\n",
      "Macrophages play a central role in atherosclerosis, contributing to plaque development and stability. Studies show that different macrophage phenotypes (M1 and M2) have distinct roles:\n",
      "- **M1 Macrophages**: Pro-inflammatory, contributing to plaque instability.\n",
      "- **M2 Macrophages**: Anti-inflammatory, involved in tissue repair but also in foam cell formation under certain conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent studies have identified other immune cells, such as B cells, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, in the atherosclerotic plaques, each contributing to the disease's progression in unique ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Diagnostic Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets\n",
      "#### Biomarkers:\n",
      "1. **C-reactive Protein (CRP)**: A marker of systemic inflammation correlated with CAD severity.\n",
      "2. **IL-6 and IL-1Œ≤**: Elevated levels are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Therapeutic Targets:\n",
      "1. **Statins**: Beyond lipid-lowering, they reduce inflammation.\n",
      "2. **PCSK9 Inhibitors**: Lower LDL levels and inflammatory markers.\n",
      "3. **Monoclonal Antibodies**:\n",
      "   - Canakinumab (IL-1Œ≤ inhibitor) has shown promise in reducing recurrent cardiovascular events.\n",
      "   - Tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor blocker) is under investigation for atherosclerosis management.\n",

      "[{\"pmid\": \"15983262\", \"title\": \"Pathophysiology of coronary artery disease.\", \"abstract\": \"During the past decade, our understanding of the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease (CAD) has undergone a remarkable evolution. We review here how these advances have altered our concepts of and clinical approaches to both the chronic and acute phases of CAD. Previously considered a cholesterol storage disease, we currently view atherosclerosis as an inflammatory disorder. The appreciation of arterial remodeling (compensatory enlargement) has expanded attention beyond stenoses evident by angiography to encompass the biology of nonstenotic plaques. Revascularization effectively relieves ischemia, but we now recognize the need to attend to nonobstructive lesions as well. Aggressive management of modifiable risk factors reduces cardiovascular events and should accompany appropriate revascularization. We now recognize that disruption of plaques that may not produce critical stenoses causes many acute coronary syndromes (ACS). The disrupted plaque represents a \\\"solid-state\\\" stimulus to thrombosis. Alterations in circulating prothrombotic or antifibrinolytic mediators in the \\\"fluid phase\\\" of the blood can also predispose toward ACS. Recent results have established the multiplicity of \\\"high-risk\\\" plaques and the widespread nature of inflammation in patients prone to develop ACS. These findings challenge our traditional view of coronary atherosclerosis as a segmental or localized disease. Thus, treatment of ACS should involve 2 overlapping phases: first, addressing the culprit lesion, and second, aiming at rapid \\\"stabilization\\\" of other plaques that may produce recurrent events. The concept of \\\"interventional cardiology\\\" must expand beyond mechanical revascularization to embrace preventive interventions that forestall future events.\", \"authors\": [\"Peter Libby\", \"Pierre Theroux\"], \"year\": \"2005\", \"volume\": \"111\", \"issue\": \"25\", \"journal\": \"Circulation\", \"citation\": \"2005;111(25)\", \"link\": \"https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.537878\", \"pdf_link\": \"No PDF link available\", \"full_content\": \"No full text link available\"}, {\"pmid\": \"31420554\", \"title\": \"Atherosclerosis.\", \"abstract\": \"Atherosclerosis, the formation of fibrofatty lesions in the artery wall, causes much morbidity and mortality worldwide, including most myocardial infarctions and many strokes, as well as disabling peripheral artery disease.

      "A comprehensive review of current literature was conducted, focusing on inflammatory processes in atherosclerosis and CAD. The search included peer-reviewed articles from PubMed, with keywords such as 'inflammation,' 'atherosclerosis,' 'coronary artery disease,' 'immune response,' and 'inflammatory markers.' Data were synthesized from multiple sources to present a cohesive understanding of the inflammation-atherogenesis link, immune cell dynamics, and therapeutic interventions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Results\n",
      "#### Inflammatory Pathways in Atherosclerosis\n",
      "Inflammation is a critical player in all stages of atherosclerosis, from initiation to plaque rupture. The process begins with endothelial dysfunction, often caused by risk factors like hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and smoking. Endothelial cells respond to these insults by expressing adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) that recruit immune cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "##### Key Players:\n",
      "1. **Lipoproteins and Oxidative Stress:**\n",
      "   - LDL particles can penetrate the endothelium and become oxidized (oxLDL).\n",
      "   - OxLDL is recognized by scavenger receptors on macrophages, leading to foam cell formation and plaque development.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Cytokines and Chemokines:**\n",
      "   - Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1Œ≤, TNF-Œ±, IL-6) are released by endothelial cells, macrophages, and T cells, perpetuating a local inflammatory response.\n",
      "   - Chemokines like MCP-1 recruit monocytes to the site of inflammation.\n",
      "   \n",
      "3. **Macrophages and T Cells:**\n",
      "   - Monocytes differentiate into macrophages that ingest lipids, becoming foam cells.\n",
      "   - T cells secrete cytokines, enhancing the inflammatory response and modulating macrophage activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Immune Cell Dynamics\n",
      "Macrophages play a central role in atherosclerosis, contributing to plaque development and stability. Studies show that different macrophage phenotypes (M1 and M2) have distinct roles:\n",
      "- **M1 Macrophages:** Pro-inflammatory, contributing to plaque instability.\n",
      "- **M2 Macrophages:** Anti-inflammatory, involved in tissue repair but also in foam cell formation under certain conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent studies have identified other immune cells, such as B cells, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, within atherosclerotic plaques, each contributing to the disease's progression uniquely.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Diagnostic Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets\n",
      "##### Biomarkers:\n",
      "1. **C-reactive Protein (CRP):** A marker of systemic inflammation correlated with CAD severity.\n",
      "2. **IL-6 and IL-1Œ≤:** Elevated levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.\n",
      "\n",
      "##### Therapeutic Targets:\n",
      "1. **Statins:** Beyond lipid-lowering, they reduce inflammation.\n",
      "2. **PCSK9 Inhibitors:** Lower LDL levels and inflammatory markers.\n",
      "3. **Monoclonal Antibodies:**\n",
      "   - Canakinumab (IL-1Œ≤ inhibitor) has shown promise in reducing recurrent cardiovascular events.\n",
      "   - Tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor blocker) is under investigation for atherosclerosis management.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Discussion\n",
      "The intricate interplay between inflammation and atherosclerosis provides numerous entry points for therapeutic intervention. Managing inflammation through lifestyle modifications and pharmacotherapy can significantly reduce the risk and severity of CAD. The success of anti-inflammatory treatments highlights the potential for targeting specific inflammatory pathways to improve cardiovascular outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Limitations of Current Research\n",
      "While advancements have been made in understanding the role of inflammation in atherosclerosis, there remain challenges:\n",
      "1. **Heterogeneity in Patient Response:** Variability in genetic and environmental factors influences treatment efficacy.\n",
      "2. **Complexity of Inflammatory Pathways:** Redundant and compensatory pathways complicate targeted therapies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further research is needed to develop personalized therapeutic strategies and to identify additional biomarkers for better disease prediction and management.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "Inflammation is crucial in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and CAD. The identification of key inflammatory pathways and immune cells involved in plaque development and instability opens new avenues for diagnosis and treatment. Integrating anti-inflammatory strategies into current treatment protocols holds promise for reducing the burden of cardiovascular diseases.\n",

However, randomized controlled trials suggest that DOACs may not be as efficacious or as safe as the current standard of care in conditions such as mechanical heart valves, thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome, and atrial fibrillation associated with rheumatic heart disease. DOACs do not provide a net benefit in conditions such as embolic stroke of undetermined source. Their efficacy is uncertain for conditions such as left ventricular thrombus, catheter-associated deep vein thrombosis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and for patients with atrial fibrillation or venous thrombosis who have end-stage renal disease.

Its prevalence is increasing because of ageing of the population and improved treatment of acute cardiovascular events, despite the efficacy of many therapies for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), Œ≤ blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and advanced device therapies. Combined angiotensin receptor blocker neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) have been associated with improvements in hospital admissions and mortality from heart failure compared with enalapril, and guidelines now recommend substitution of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with ARNIs in appropriate patients. Improved safety of left ventricular assist devices means that these are becoming more commonly used in patients with severe symptoms. Antidiabetic therapies might further improve outcomes in patients with heart failure. New drugs with novel mechanisms of action, such as cardiac myosin activators, are under investigation for patients with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is a heterogeneous disorder that remains incompletely understood and will continue to increase in prevalence with the ageing population.

To answer this \\nquestion, information on the patient must be collected, and a good diagnostic test utilizing \\nsuch information must be in place. Tree-based analyses provide one solution for constructing \\nsuch diagnostic tests [1,2].\\nOriginally tree-based methods were developed for classification and subsequently regression \\n[3]. Later, interest in tree-based methods for survival (i.e. continuous time-to-event) data \\narose from the need of clinical researchers to define interpretable rules for prognostication, \\nas well as identifying patient subgroups for clinical trial design [4‚Äì10]. Tree-based methods \\noffer a natural way of ‚Äúbinning‚Äù patients, allowing researchers to compare risk estimates \\nacross the ‚Äúbins‚Äù [4]. Furthermore, they are adept at capturing non-linear and heterogeneous \\neffects, and can automatically detect interactions (i.e. without the need to having the \\ninteractions specified a priori). From these respects, tree-based methods offer potential \\nimprovement over traditional regression models.\\nMore recently, single trees have been expanded to forests or ensemble of trees with the goal \\nof achieving improved prediction accuracy and addressing instability that often plagues a \\nsingle tree [11,12]. Representative tree from an ensemble offers a useful tool for gaining \\ninsights into clinical decision-making, while still harnessing the improved prediction \\naccuracy of the ensemble [13]. Trees are appealing to clinicians because they serve as a very \\nhuman representation to data. In contrast, statisticians find them appealing because they \\nserve as a good base learner for ensemble methods.\\nThe current paper provides a review of tree-based methods, with a focus on the \\nmethodological aspects, implementation and interpretation of results from such analyses. \\nThe target audience is clinical researchers and practitioners familiar with basic regression \\nframework (e.g. linear regression, logistic regression, proportional hazards regression), but \\nlittle or no prior experience with tree-based analyses. We present two heart disease \\nexamples, along with programming code and data sets, to illustrate the power of tree-based \\nmethods for diagnostic classification and prognostication.\\n2 Tree-based Methods\\nThe literature on tree-based methods dates from work in the social sciences. In statistics, \\nBreiman et al. had a seminal influence both in bringing the work to the attention of \\nstatisticians and in proposing new algorithms for constructing trees [3]. At around the same \\ntime decision tree induction was beginning to be used in the field of machine learning, and \\nin engineering.\\nThe terminology of trees is graphic: a tree T has a root which is the top node, and \\nobservations are passed down the tree, with decisions being made at each node (also called \\ndaughters) until a terminal node or leaf is reached. Each non-terminal node (also called \\ninternal node) contains a question on which a split is based. The terminal nodes of a tree T \\nare collectively denoted by T, and the number of terminal nodes is denoted by T . Each \\nterminal node contains the class label (for a classification problem) or an average response \\nBanerjee et al.\\nPage 2\\nCirc Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 May 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\n(for a least-squares regression problem). Nodes in a tree can also be chance, or probability, \\nnodes. The branch Tt that stems from node t includes t itself and all its daughters. A subtree \\nof T is a tree with root a node of T; it is a rooted subtree if its root is the root of T.\\nIn the classification and regression tree (CART) paradigm, the covariate space is partitioned \\nrecursively in a binary fashion. The partitioning is intended to increase within-node \\nhomogeneity, where homogeneity is determined by the dependent variable in the problem. \\nThere are three basic elements for constructing a tree under the CART paradigm. These are: \\n(1) tree growing, (2) finding the ‚Äúright-sized‚Äù tree, and (3) testing. The first element is aimed \\nat addressing the question how and why a parent node is split into daughter nodes. CART \\nuses binary splits, phrased in terms of the covariates, that partition the predictor space. Each \\nsplit depends upon the value of a single covariate. For ordered (continuous or categorical) \\ncovariates, Xj, only splits resulting from questions of the form ‚ÄúIs Xj ‚â§ c?‚Äù for c ‚àà \\ndomain(Xj) are considered, thereby allowing at most n‚àí1 splits for a sample of size n. For \\nexample, for patients who came to emergency departments with acute chest pain, systolic \\nblood pressure was evaluated to predict the need for intensive care [1]. The recursive \\npartitioning analysis assessed every possible split of the form ‚Äúis systolic blood pressure less \\nthan or equal to 100 mm Hg, 105 mm Hg, 110 mm Hg etc.‚Äù (corresponding to each unique \\nvalue of systolic blood pressure in the dataset except the maximum value). For nominal \\ncovariates no constraints on possible subdivisions are imposed. Thus, for a nominal \\ncovariate with M categories, there are 2M‚àí1‚àí1 splits to examine. For example, in evaluating \\nrace/ethnicity (with categories whites, african americans, hispanics, others) as a potential \\nsplitter, there are a total of 7 splits to consider, namely (whites vs. the rest), (african \\namericans vs. the rest), (hispanics vs. the rest), (asians vs. the rest), (whites and african \\namericans vs. hispanics and others), (whites and hispanics versus african americans and \\nothers), and (whites and others vs. african americans and hispanics).\\nThe natural question that comes next is, how do we select one or several preferred splits \\nfrom the pool of allowable splits? Before selecting the best split, one must define the \\ngoodness of split. The objective of splitting is to make the two daughter nodes as \\nhomogeneous as possible. Therefore, the goodness of a split must weigh the homogeneities \\nin the two daughter nodes. Extent of node homogeneity is measured quantitatively using an \\nimpurity function [3]. Potential splits are evaluated for each of the covariates, and the \\ncovariate and split value resulting in the greatest reduction in impurity is chosen.\\nCorresponding to a split s at node t into left and right daughter nodes tL and tR, the reduction \\nin impurity is given by\\nŒîI s, t = i t ‚àíP tL i tL ‚àíP tR i tR ,\\nwhere i(t) is the impurity in node t, and P (tL) and P (tR) are the probabilities that a subject \\nfalls in nodes tL and tR, respectively. For classification problems, i(t) is measured in terms of \\nentropy or Gini impurity [3]. In most practical situations though, there is very little \\ndifference between the two criteria. For regression problems, i(t) is typically the mean \\nresidual sum of squares. The probabilities P(tL) and P(tR) are estimated via corresponding \\nBanerjee et al.\\nPage 3\\nCirc Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 May 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nsample proportions. The splitting rule that maximizes ŒîI(s, t) over the set S of all possible \\nsplits is chosen as the best splitter for node t. In the context of the chest pain study, systolic \\nblood pressure (covariate chosen) of less than 110 mm Hg (value/threshold chosen for the \\nspecific covariate) was found to be the best splitter for a node in the tree based on goodness \\nof split [1].\\nA useful feature of CART is that of growing a large tree and then pruning it back to find the \\n‚Äúright-sized tree‚Äù. The point is to find a subtree of the ‚Äúlarge‚Äù tree that is most ‚Äúpredictive‚Äù \\nof the outcome and least vulnerable to the noise in the data. Let c(t) be the misclassification \\nat a node t. Now define C(T) to be the misclassification for the entire tree \\nT:C T = ‚àët ‚ààT P t c t . Note that C(T) is a measure of the quality of the tree T. The purpose \\nof pruning is to select the best subtree of an initially overgrown (or saturated) tree, such that \\nC(T) is minimized. In this context, an important concept is tree cost-complexity [3]. It is \\ndefined as\\nCŒ± T = C T + Œ± T ,\\nwhere Œ± (‚â• 0) is a penalty parameter for the complexity of the tree. The total number of \\nterminal nodes, T , is used as a measure of tree complexity. Note that the total number of \\nnodes in a tree T (i.e. its size) is twice the number of its terminal nodes minus 1. Thus, tree \\ncomplexity is really another term for the size of the tree. The difference between CŒ± (T) and \\nC(T) as a measure of tree quality resides in that CŒ± (T) penalizes a large tree.\\nFor any tree, there are many subtrees, and therefore many ways to prune. The challenge is \\nhow to prune, i.e. which subtrees to cut first. Breiman et al. [3] showed that (1) for any value \\nof the penalty parameter Œ±, there is a unique smallest subtree of T that minimizes the cost-\\ncomplexity, and (2) if Œ±1 > Œ±2, the optimal subtree corresponding to Œ±1 is a subtree of the \\noptimal subtree corresponding to Œ±2. The use of tree cost-complexity therefore allows one to \\nconstruct a sequence of nested optimal subtrees from any given tree T. This is done by \\nrecursively pruning the branch(es) with the weakest link; that is, the node t with the smallest \\nvalue of Œ± such that CŒ±(t) ‚â§ CŒ±(Tt).\\nHaving obtained a nested sequence of pruned optimal subtrees, one is left with the problem \\nof selecting a best tree from this sequence. Using a test sample or cross-validation is \\nrecommended to obtain honest estimates of C(T). The subtree with the smallest \\nmisclassification cost is chosen as the final tree [3,14]. In the context of the chest pain study, \\nthe final tree had four terminal nodes that identified patient subgroups in terms of very low, \\nlow, moderate, and high risk of complications [1].\\nLastly, it is worth mentioning that while CART is the most commonly used tree method in \\nbiomedical applications, other tree growing algorithms have been proposed that offer \\nimprovements on various aspects of CART. These include CHAID (Chi-Squared Automated \\nInteraction Detection), QUEST (Quick, Unbiased and Effcient Statistical Tree), and GUIDE \\n(Generalized, Unbiased Interaction Detection and Estimation) [15‚Äì18]. In contrast to CART, \\nCHAID builds non-binary trees that tend to be ‚Äúwider‚Äù, i.e. yielding many terminal nodes \\nBanerjee et al.\\nPage 4\\nCirc Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 May 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nconnected to a single branch, which can be conveniently summarized in a simple two-way \\ntable with multiple categories for each variable or dimension of the table. This makes the \\nCHAID method particularly popular in market research applications. Also, CART can be \\nbiased towards selecting covariates with many possible splits (i.e. covariates which have \\nmany unique values in the observed data) or missing values. The QUEST and GUIDE \\nalgorithms, in contrast, provide unbiased alternatives for split variable selection. More \\nrecently, tree growing algorithms have been proposed based on a inference framework, \\nwhich incorporates tree growing and stopping rule based on the concept of statistical \\nsignificance and implemented via formal hypothesis tests [19].\\n2.1 Tree Ensemble\\nThe mechanism of selecting a best split in CART and the recursive partitioning of data leads \\nto smaller and smaller data sets. This can lead to instability in the tree structure, whereby \\nsmall changes in the data and/or algorithm inputs can have dramatic effects on the nature of \\nthe solution (variables and splits selected). Another major shortcoming of CART is its \\nmodest prediction performance. Growing an ensemble (collection) of trees is a way to fix \\nthese problems [11,12,20]. It also leads to classifiers and predictors that are drawn from a \\nricher class of models [21]. Ensemble methods such as bagging, random forest, and boosting \\ncan yield substantial prediction improvements over a single tree, and are known to be stable \\n[11,12,20]. Improvements can be achieved through either bias or variance reduction. It is \\nthis principle (i.e. bias versus variance reduction) that motivates how an ensemble is grown.\\nBagging [11] involves random manipulation of the training data via bootstrap to reduce \\nvariance. A large number of pseudo datasets are generated by resampling the original \\nobservations with replacement, and a tree grown on each pseudo dataset. This results in an \\nensemble of trees. Predictions from individual trees are averaged to make the overall \\nprediction from the ensemble, thereby reducing variance. In boosting [20], instead of \\nrandom resampling, the data are iteratively reweighted to reduce bias. The algorithm \\nalternates between fitting a tree and reweighting the data. The weights are adaptively chosen, \\nwith more weight given to observations that the tree models poorly. An ensemble of trees \\nresult, that serves to reduce the bias.\\nThe simple mechanism whereby bagging reduces prediction error, is well understood in \\nterms of variance reduction resulting from averaging [20]. Such variance gains can be \\nenhanced by reducing the correlation between the quantities being averaged. Random forest, \\na second-generation bagging method, is based on this principle [12]. It is an ensemble of \\nunpruned classification or regression trees, induced from bootstrap resamples of the training \\ndata, using random feature selection in the tree induction process. Correlation reduction is \\nachieved by the random feature selection. Instead of determining the optimal split of a given \\nnode of a tree by evaluating all allowable splits on all covariates, as is done with growing a \\nsingle tree, a subset of the covariates drawn at random is employed. The process (to grow the \\ntrees in the forest) is as follows: (1) Bootstrap the training data. Grow each tree on an \\nindependent bootstrap sample, (2) At each node, randomly select m covariates out of all M \\npossible covariates. For theoretical reasons, the optimal choice of m is typically M. Find \\nthe best split on the selected m covariates, (3) Grow the tree to maximal depth under the \\nBanerjee et al.\\nPage 5\\nCirc Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes.

No pruning is performed. (4) Repeat \\nfor each bootstrap sample. (5) Prediction is made by aggregating (majority vote for \\nclassification or averaging for regression) the predictions of the ensemble.\\nEstimate of prediction error is best obtained using an external ‚Äútest‚Äù dataset. In the absence \\nof such data, an honest estimate of the prediction error is obtained as follows: (1) At each \\nbootstrap iteration, predict the data not in the bootstrap sample (this is termed ‚Äúout-of-bag‚Äù \\ndata) using the tree grown with the bootstrap sample. (2) Average the out-of-bag predictions. \\nCalculate the error rate using the out-of-bag predictions, and call it the out-of-bag estimate \\nof error. Given that enough trees have been grown, the ‚Äúout-of-bag‚Äù estimate of error is an \\naccurate estimate of test set prediction error rate [12]. Random forests demonstrate \\nexceptional prediction accuracy, comparable to artificial neural networks and support vector \\nmachines [12]. Furthermore, a by-product of forest is a ranking of covariates in terms of the \\nvariable importance [12] in the forest. The ranking is done based on the idea that if a \\nvariable is not important, then rearranging the values of that variable will not affect \\nprediction accuracy. Finally, some interesting extensions of Breiman‚Äôs random forest include \\nweighted forests that incorporate tree-level weights to emphasize more accurate trees in \\nprediction [22], and causal random forests for estimation and inference of heterogeneous \\ntreatment effects [23,24].\\n2.2 Representative Tree from Ensemble\\nCompared to a single tree, ensemble methods typically offer substantial gains in predictive \\naccuracy, and are known to be stable. However, individual trees are lost in the ensemble. \\nThis is a significant loss, given that a tree is often used for clinical insights and decision \\nmaking. While a tree from a single run should not be used for decision making, a \\nrepresentative tree from an ensemble may offer clinical insights, while still harnessing the \\nimproved prediction accuracy of the ensemble [13]. Methods have been proposed to identify \\nthe most representative tree from an ensemble [13]. Quite often, the problem may not be as \\nbad as it seems; although hundreds of distinct trees are identified, many will differ only at a \\nfew nodes. Other trees may have different architectures, but produce similar partitions of the \\ncovariate space. By defining several similarity metrics on trees, an ensemble can be \\nsummarized by several representative trees [13]. Common choices of metrics include \\n‚Äúsimilarity‚Äù in the terminal nodes (i.e. how similarly patients are binned), and in predictions.\\nThe similarity score D(T) for a tree T is computed by averaging the individual distance \\nmetrics between tree T and all other trees in the ensemble. This is the average distance \\nbetween tree T and all other trees in the ensemble. So a low score for a tree indicates its \\nsimilarity to all other trees in the ensemble. The score D(T) is computed for each of the \\ndistance metrics (i.e. d0, d1, d2, d1\\n‚àó) and the representative trees in the ensemble are chosen \\nbased on the smallest D(T) values [13].\\n2.3 Trees for Survival Data\\nFor survival data, typically the outcome variable is time (continuous) to occurrence of an \\nevent of interest. The event can be death, occurrence of a disease, recurrence of a disease, \\nBanerjee et al.\\nPage 6\\nCirc Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 May 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\netc. The time to event or survival time can be measured in days, weeks, years, etc. For \\nexample, if the event of interest is myocardial infarction, then the survival time can be the \\ntime in years until a person develops a myocardial infarction.\\nObservations are censored when the information about their survival time is incomplete; the \\nmost commonly encountered form is right censoring. Suppose patients are followed in a \\nstudy for 20 weeks. A patient who does not experience the event of interest for the duration \\nof the study is said to be right censored. The survival time for this person is considered to be \\nat least as long as the duration of the study. Another example of right censoring is when a \\nperson drops out of the study before the end of the study observation time and did not \\nexperience the event. This person‚Äôs survival time is said to be censored, since we know that \\nthe event of interest did not happen while this person was under observation. Censoring is an \\nimportant issue in survival analysis, representing a particular type of missing data, and needs \\nto be appropriately accounted in order to avoid bias.\\nSeveral extensions of CART have been proposed in the above setting [5‚Äì10]. Algorithms for \\ngrowing trees for survival data can be broadly classified under two general approaches. The \\nfirst involves quantifying the within-node homogeneity with a statistic that measures how \\nsimilar the subjects are in each node and choosing splits that minimize the within-node error. \\nOne such algorithm assumes the popular semiparamateric Cox model at each node, and \\nconstructs the within-node measure based on residuals from the Cox model [5,8]. In this \\napproach, the entire CART engineering is adopted, including cost-complexity pruning and \\ncross-validation for final tree selection.\\nAn alternative approach is to summarize the dissimilarity in survival experiences between \\ntwo groups induced by a split and choose splits that maximize this difference [9,10]. One \\nsuch algorithm uses the two-sample log-rank statistic to measure the separation in survival \\ntimes between two daughter nodes. The two-sample log-rank statistic is chosen because of \\nits extensive use in the survival analysis setting, and also because it is an appropriate \\nmeasure of dissimilarity in survival between two groups. Partitioning a node, involves \\nfinding the split s, among all variables that maximizes the two-sample log-rank statistic, and \\nhence the between-node separation. In this context, an optimal pruning algorithm that \\nborrows the idea of weakest link cutting from CART, has been suggested [9]. The algorithm, \\nnamely split-complexity pruning, repeatedly prunes off branches with smallest average log-\\nrank statistics in the branch [9]. Once a sequence of optimally pruned subtrees is obtained, \\nthe next step is to select the best tree from this sequence. Since the same data are used to \\nselect the split point and variable, as well as to calculate the statistic, bootstrap resampling is \\nused to obtain a bias-corrected version of the split complexity for the final tree selection.\\nMethods for constructing survival tree ensembles have also been proposed in the literature \\n[25‚Äì30]. One approach involves substituting suitably chosen residuals for the survival \\nendpoint. The most popular choice is null deviance residuals from a Cox proportional \\nhazards model [29]. This allows the analyst to apply random forest methodology suitable for \\ncontinuous data to the transformed outcome, thereby circumventing difficulties induced by \\ncensoring. Another approach builds a relative risk forest under a proportional hazards \\nassumption by exploiting an equivalence to Poisson tree likelihoods and using existing \\nBanerjee et al.\\nPage 7\\nCirc Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 May 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nrandom forest methodology [28]. A third approach [26] uses log-transformed survival time \\nas the outcome in a weighted random forest regression analysis. Observations in the \\nregression analysis are weighted by, what are referred to as, inverse probability of censoring \\nweights. All of these aforementioned approaches recast the survival setting into one that can \\nbe treated using existing forest methodology. A more recent approach directly incorporates \\nsurvival time and censoring information in the splitting criterion for growing a forest [30]. \\nEnsemble predictions from the forest account for the censored data structure directly, and \\nmay therefore provide a more interpretable analytic framework from a clinical standpoint. \\nThe tree that is most similar to other trees in the ensemble in terms of binning patients and \\nsurvival predictions, is chosen as the most representative tree from the ensemble [13].\\n3 Methods\\n3.1 Example Datasets\\n3.1.1 Ischemic Heart Disease Classification‚ÄîIschemic heart disease (IHD) affects \\nmillions of people and is the most common cause of death worldwide [31]. IHD is typically \\ncaused by a partial or total obstruction of a coronary artery due to atherosclerotic coronary \\nartery disease (CAD), causing reduced myocardial blood flow and ischemia.\\nIn patients with single vessel CAD, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the \\nrecommended reperfusion strategy. However, a large number of patients referred for PCI \\nbecause of suspected CAD do not have any angiographic evidence of coronary artery \\nobstruction (<50% stenosis) when examined [32]. For example, up to 14% of all patients \\nwith biomarker confirmed myocardial infarction (MI) do not have obstructive CAD [33,34]. \\nMI with no obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) represents a heterogeneous patient \\ngroup of both cardiac and non-cardiac conditions mimicking MI, such as coronary artery \\nspasm, perimyocarditis, thrombophilia disorders, demand-induced, or type 2 MI [33,34,35]. \\nIt is not possible to distinguish between MINOCA and MI by routine clinical examinations.\\nIn this first example, we demonstrate the use of tree-based methods to classify patients for \\nhaving obstructive CAD (binary outcome: yes/no), defined as having coronary artery \\nstenosis diameter of less than 50%. The analytic cohort comprised of 920 patients, of whom \\n509 (55.3%) had CAD.

Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 May 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nrecommend a treatment goal of systolic blood pressure below 140‚Äì150 mm Hg depending \\non age, and below 130 mm Hg in patients with diabetes [36‚Äì39].\\nThe Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) trial recently showed that targeting \\na blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg compared to 140 mm Hg in non-diabetic patients \\nfurther reduced the overall risk of adverse cardiovascular events [39]. The SPRINT trial \\nfocused on patients who were at high risk of cardiovascular events (i.e. patients with \\nprevious cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease). It is unknown whether the same \\nbenefits apply to patients with isolated hypertension.\\nIn this second example using the SPRINT data, we illustrate the use of tree-based methods \\nto risk stratify patients based on clinical characteristics. The analytic cohort comprised of \\n9361 patients enrolled between November 2010 and March 2013. The outcome of interest is \\ntime to any adverse event (i.e. myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, heart \\nfailure or CVD death). Thus, for this example, the outcome is continuous and censored. \\nMedian follow-up was 3.2 years. Of the 9361 patients, 562 experienced an event during the \\nfollow-up period. The following covariates were included in the analyses: smoking status \\n(never, former, current), race (black, Hispanic, white, other), gender, age, cholesterol (mg/\\ndL), glucose (mg/dL), HDL (mg/dL), triglycerides (mg/dL), urine albumine, serum \\ncreatinine (mg/g), eGFR, BMI, systolic blood pressure (mmHg), diastolic blood pressure \\n(mmHg), Framingham 10-year CVD risk (> 15%or ‚â§ 15%), anti-hypertensive agents (yes/\\nno), daily aspirin (yes/no), statin (yes/no), and clinical or subclinical CVD (yes/no) defined \\naccording to the SPRINT trial protocol [39].\\n3.2 Statistical Analyses\\nAll analyses were performed using the statistical program R v.3.2.3. For our first case study \\n(heart disease classification problem: binary outcome), we used the machine learning in R \\n(mlr) package to analyze the data [40]. We specifically called upon the recursive partitioning \\n(rpart) and random forest (randomForest) packages to create each of the classifiers [41,42]. \\nFor the second case study (SPRINT data: censored survival outcome), we used the rpart \\npackage again to generate the single tree analysis. Survival tree ensemble and random forest \\nanalyses were performed using a fast implementation of random forests (ranger) package \\n[41,43].\\nFor the ensemble methods, we generated 1000 bootstrap samples from the data to grow \\nbagged as well as Random Forest classifiers, and predictions were obtained using out-of-bag \\ndata. We used Harrell‚Äôs c-statistic [44] to assess prediction accuracy. Most experts state that \\na c-statistic of 0.50 is the same as a coin toss, a c-statistic in the range of (0.5‚Äì0.7] represents \\n‚Äúpoor‚Äù discrimination, (0.7‚Äì0.8] adequate, (0.8‚Äì0.9] excellent, and >0.9 represents \\noutstanding discrimination [45,46]. For all three methods, estimates of prediction accuracy \\nwere obtained using out-of-bag data. In addition, for the single tree analyses, we also used \\n10-fold cross validation (which is the industry standard for CART) to obtain prediction \\naccuracies. The resulting c-statistics are very similar to those obtained using out-of-bag data.\\nFinally, we compared our tree based analyses results to logistic regression for the heart \\ndisease classification study, and Cox proportional hazards regression for the SPRINT study. \\nBanerjee et al.\\nPage 9\\nCirc Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 May 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nTo make a fair comparison between the traditional methods and tree based methods, we first \\nperformed stepwise variable selection to choose covariates for the logistic regression or Cox \\nmodel.\\n4 Results\\n4.1 Ischemic Heart Disease Classification\\nThe goal of this analysis was to build a clinician friendly predictive tool for classifying \\npatients as having obstructive CAD (yes/no), based on clinical and sociodemographic \\ncharacteristics. Figure 1 shows the single best tree with a c-statistic of 0.81. At each level of \\nthe tree, we show the best splitter (covariate with cutpoint). Circles denote terminal nodes in \\nthe tree. For each terminal node, we present the class prediction for that node (CAD or no \\nCAD), the total number of patients (denoted by n), and the crude number of patients with \\nCAD (denoted by r) in the terminal node. Competitor splits (i.e. covariate with cutpoint that \\nhad the second largest value of the split statistic) were also generated at each step of the tree \\n(data not shown). Knowledge of such splits enable the elucidation of alternate, competing \\nmodels.\\nThe root node was split by chest pain; patients with no chest pain were separated from those \\nwith chest pain. Interestingly, probability analysis had established almost forty years ago \\nthat the clinical history of chest pain was more reliable than stress testing to make a \\ndiagnosis of obstructive coronary disease [47]. The competitor split for chest pain at the root \\nnode was exercise induced angina. The patient subgroup with chest pain was further split by \\nage (<56 versus ‚â• 56). The competitor split at this step was ST depression induced by \\nexercise relative to rest. Of note, the subgroup with chest pain and age<56 years had the \\nlowest risk of obstructive CAD (16%) and formed terminal node I. The subgroup with chest \\npain, and age 56 years was next split by gender. Females older than 56 years with chest pain \\nhad a 20% risk of having obstructive CAD, whereas males of the same age group with chest \\npain had a 56.4% risk of having CAD. The subgroup with no chest pain was not split any \\nfurther, and formed terminal node IV with the highest risk of CAD (79%).\\nNext, we built an ensemble of heart disease classifiers using 1000 bootstrap samples from \\nthe original data. The c-statistic for the bagged ensemble was 0.89 and that for the random \\nforest was 0.88. Both provide a boost in classification accuracy compared to the single tree. \\nFigure 2 shows the variable importance plot from the random forest. The most representative \\ntree from the random forest is in Figure 3. This tree is most similar to all other trees in the \\nforest in terms of patient risk prediction. Similar to the single tree analysis results, the \\nrepresentative tree also splits first by chest pain, followed by age. Additionally, the \\nrepresentative tree splits by patient resting electrocardiographic results, and ST depression \\nlevels induced by exercise relative to rest. This tree identified five terminal nodes, with the \\nrisk of CAD varying from 16% to 79% in the lowest to highest risk groups (similar to the \\nsingle tree analyses).\\nLogistic regression with stepwise selection chose a final model with age, gender, chest pain, \\nmaximum heart rate achieved during stress test, exercise induced angina, ST depression \\nBanerjee et al.\\nPage 10\\nCirc Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 May 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\ninduced by exercise relative to rest, fasting blood pressure and cholesterol level as significant \\npredictors of obstructive CAD. The c-statistic for the logistic regression model was 0.89.\\n4.2 Adverse Heart Event Prognostication\\nThe goal of this second analysis was to build a clinical tool to help stratify patients with \\nhypertension into adverse heart prognosis groups, using sociodemographic and clinical \\nvariables. Figure 4 shows the single best tree based on the assumption of a Cox model at \\neach node. The c-statistic for this tree with three terminal nodes was 0.64. At each level of \\nthe tree, we show the best splitter (covariate with cutpoint). Circles denote terminal nodes in \\nthe tree. For each terminal node, we present the total number of patients (denoted by n), the \\n(crude) number of events (denoted by r), and the estimated 3-year survival (denoted by 3Yr) \\nfor patients in that terminal node. Once again, competitor splits were also generated at each \\nstep of the tree (data not shown).\\nThe single tree was very simple, with the first split based on a patient‚Äôs history of subclinical \\nCVD. Patients without any history of subclinical CVD were further split by age. The best \\nprognosis was for patients age < 71 years without subclinical CVD, and this group had an \\nestimated 3-year survival of 97.2%. The worst prognosis was for patients with history of \\nsubclinical CVD, and this group had an estimated 3-year survival of 88%.\\nNext, we built an ensemble of survival trees using 1000 bootstrapped samples from the \\noriginal data. The c-statistic for the bagged ensemble was 0.66 and that for the random forest \\nwas 0.67. The ensemble resulted in a very small boost in prediction accuracy compared to \\nthe single survival tree. Figure 5 shows the variable importance plot from the random \\nsurvival forest. The most representative tree from the forest is in Figure 6. This tree was \\nmost similar to all other trees in the forest in terms of 3-year survival predictions. Based on \\nthis representative tree, the best prognosis was for patients with urine albumin < 15.8 and \\nage < 76 years. The estimated 3-year survival for this group was 97%. In contrast, the worst \\nprognosis was for patients with urine albumin ‚â• 15.8 and history of subclinical CVD. The \\nestimated 3-year survival for this group was 81%.\\nCox proportional hazards regression with stepwise selection chose a final model with age, \\nsmoking status, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL, urine albumin, serum \\ncreatinine, eGFR, daily aspirin use, use of anti-hypertensive agent, and history of clinical or \\nsubclinical CVD as significant predictors of survival. The c-statistic for the Cox model was \\n0.69.\\n5 Conclusions\\nClinical decision-making tools are often developed using regression models that rely on \\nrestrictive assumptions (e.g. proportional hazards). Observed data may not always conform \\nto such assumptions. Since these models are often parametric, nonlinear effects of variables \\nmust also be assessed using ad hoc approaches, such as stepwise regression, or using \\ntransformations. Furthermore, discovery of interactions is di cult, because the interactions \\nhave to be specified a priori. All these difficulties can be automatically handled by using \\ntree-based methods.\\nBanerjee et al.\\nPage 11\\nCirc Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 May 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nTraditional regression models favor global effects, that is, factors that have uniform effect \\nacross the entire patient population. Tree-based methods, however, can uncover factors that \\nmay act differently in different patient subgroups. This is an important point, given that in an \\nindividual patient, the discriminating power of one factor may be significantly enhanced or \\novershadowed by the presence or absence of other factors. Also, tree-based methods provide \\na superior means for risk classification. Rather than fitting a model to the data, tree-based \\nmethods sequentially divide the patient group into two subgroups based on prognostic factor \\nvalues (e.g., age < 56 years vs ‚â• 56 years). The repeated partitioning creates ‚Äúbins‚Äù of \\npatients that are approximately homogeneous. This permits the use of risk estimation to \\ncompare across the ‚Äúbins‚Äù. The combination of binning and the interpretability of the \\nresulting tree structure make these methods extremely well suited for use as clinical \\ndecision-making tools.\\nIn addition to discrimination (as assessed by the c-statistic), the evaluation of a tree-based \\nmodel (for that matter, any statistical prediction model) should ideally also include its \\ncalibration. Compared with discrimination, which indicates the ability of a risk model to \\nrank order an individual patient‚Äôs risk, calibration measures the ability of a model to predict \\nthe absolute risk that is observed. For a classification problem, the idea is to produce \\npredicted probabilities of a patient belonging to each possible class, instead of predicting \\nclass values directly. Unfortunately, tree based methods and other non-linear machine \\nlearning methods such as support vector machines, often produce poorly calibrated \\nprobabilities, and may benefit from recalibration in certain scenarios. Although outside the \\nscope of this paper, probability calibration trees [48] have recently been developed to \\naddress this issue.\\nWe illustrate tree-based methods using two heart disease datasets. For the ischemic heart \\ndisease data the endpoint was binary, whereas for the SPRINT data the endpoint was \\ncensored time. We illustrate the ease with which tree-based methods can handle these \\nvarious outcome types. There are many versions of free-wares implementing tree-based \\nmethods. Most of these are available as R packages through CRAN (http://cran.r-\\nproject.org/). Specific references for rpart, randomForest, and ranger are provided in the \\nbibliography [40‚Äì43].

      "# Effects of a New Drug on Heart Disease\n",
      "\n",
      "## Abstract\n",
      "This study investigates the effects of a new drug on heart disease, focusing on its efficacy, side effects, and overall impact on patient outcomes. We employed a randomized controlled trial design to evaluate the drug, comparing it with standard treatments. Our findings indicate significant improvements in heart disease management with the new drug, supported by robust data analyses and relevant literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "Heart disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating continuous advancements in treatment modalities. This study evaluates the effects of a newly developed drug designed to improve heart disease outcomes, based on its physiological impact, dosage, and comparative efficacy to existing treatments.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Methodology\n",
      "### Study Design\n",
      "A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted, enrolling 500 patients diagnosed with various forms of heart disease. Participants were randomly assigned to either the treatment group receiving the new drug or a control group receiving standard treatment. The trial spanned 12 months, with regular follow-ups and assessments.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\n",
      "Inclusion criteria were patients aged 40-75 with a confirmed diagnosis of heart disease, including heart failure, myocardial infarction, and chronic coronary artery disease. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, end-stage renal disease, uncontrolled hypertension, and known drug allergies.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Drug Administration\n",
      "The new drug was administered orally at a dosage of 50mg daily. The control group received standard care, including beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins. Both groups were monitored for adherence and potential side effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Data Collection\n",
      "Primary endpoints included changes in ejection fraction, incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), and quality of life assessed through the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). Secondary endpoints comprised hospitalization rates, biomarkers such as NT-proBNP, and side effect profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Statistical Analysis\n",
      "Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat principles. Descriptive statistics summarized baseline characteristics. Differences between groups were assessed using independent t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards models evaluated time-to-event data.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Results\n",
      "### Baseline Characteristics\n",
      "The baseline characteristics of the two groups were comparable in terms of age, gender distribution, baseline heart disease severity, and comorbidities.\n",
      "\n",

    "\n",
    "Autogen is inherently designed to be extensible, allowing developers to customize and augment its capabilities to meet specific enterprise requirements. By leveraging object-oriented programming principles like inheritance and encapsulation, you can create subclasses of core components such as `ConversableAgent` and introduce custom models or functionalities. This extensibility enables the integration of proprietary APIs, specialized processing logic, and enterprise-specific workflows without modifying the original codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modular Architecture**: The modular design and event-driven architecture, using triggers and registered reply functions, make it straightforward to insert custom behavior that responds to particular events or messages within the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Robust Logging**: Implement detailed custom logging using Python's module for effective monitoring and troubleshooting, which is essential in a production environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Proper error handling ensures that exceptions are managed gracefully, providing meaningful feedback and maintaining system stability.\n",
