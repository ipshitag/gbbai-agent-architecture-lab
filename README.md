# 🤖  AI Agentic Lab: Exploring Single and Multi-Agent Architectures

Welcome to the **Intro to Agentic Architectures Lab**! This is your go-to space for exploring, designing, and implementing agent-based AI systems in Azure. Our mission is to help you understand and build single-agent systems, foundational orchestration frameworks, and advanced multi-agent strategies. We leverage the power of Azure Foundry (Azure AI services) and leading AI frameworks like Autogen and Semantic Kernel to provide you with the best resources and tools for building agentic designs.

**Let’s build the future of AI, one agent at a time! 🚀**

## 🌟 Project Overview
This repository is designed to:

- **Understanding Single-Agent Systems**: Develop a robust understanding of the core architecture, functionalities, and deployment strategies for single-agent systems. Learn how these systems serve as the foundation for more complex multi-agent designs.

- **Azure AI Agent Services**: Harness the power of Azure’s AI Agent Services to deploy scalable, reliable, and cloud-native agentic systems. Understand how these services facilitate seamless integration, orchestration, and management of both single and multi-agent environments.

- **Framework Exploration**: Dive deep into Autogen (v1 and v2) and Semantic Kernel (SK), exploring their features, capabilities, and practical applications in real-world scenarios. These frameworks simplify the orchestration of agents and enable powerful multi-agent interactions.

- **Demystifying Multi-Agent Architectures**: Transition from single-agent designs to sophisticated multi-agent systems. Build architectures that emphasize communication, coordination, and collaboration. Leverage SK and Autogen to create dynamic, event-driven, and scalable multi-agent ecosystems.


## 🚀 Getting Started
Are you ready to dive into developing Agentic AI systems? 

1. **📋 Environment Setup**: Begin with the `00-set-up-env.ipynb` notebook to configure your environment and dependencies.

    > **Note**: Before getting started, if this is your first time dealing with agentic systems, please refer to the `AGENTS-FAQ.md` file for basic `auto` Q&A session.

2. **🛠 Building Single Agents with Azure AI agent Service**: Understand the foundations of single-agent architecturesand building `Managed agent micro-services`:
    - `01-single-agent-with-azure-ai-agents.ipynb`

3. **📚 Introduction to Semantic Kernel Framework**: Learn about Semantic Kernel and its role in orchestration with: 
    - `02-frameworks-intro-to-semantic-kernel.ipynb`.

4. **🔍 Exploring Autogen Framework**: Dive into Autogen:
    > In January 2025, AutoGen released its new generation v0.4—a significant evolution from version 0.2.  
    > No stress—review Notebook 03 and then proceed to Notebook 03b to understand why the new design is the `event`we needed.
    - `03-frameworks-intro-to-autogen-v0.2.ipynb`
    - `03b-frameworks-intro-to-autogen-v0.4.ipynb`

5. **🌐 Learn how to build Multi-Agent Architectures**: Explore advanced patterns and examples of multi-agent systems in:\
    > Caution: SK Agentic framework is in `Experimental` phase
    - `04-multi-agent-architectures-with-sk-agentic-framework.ipynb`
    - `05-multi-agent-architectures-with-azure-ai-agents-service-and-sk-autogen.ipynb`

## 📖 Upcoming Features

We are committed to expanding this lab with more resources, including:
- More advanced use cases for multi-agent.
- Tools and utilities for debugging and optimizing agent performance.
- End-to-end event-driven architecture samples to demonstrate dynamic and responsive agent interactions in multi-agent scenarios.
- Integration of MaS with M365 ecosystem.

Stay tuned as we continue to explore the exciting world of AI agents!
