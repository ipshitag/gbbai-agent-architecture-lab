# ðŸ¤–  AI Agentic Lab: Build Single and Multi-Agent Systems in Azure

Welcome to the **Agentic System Design Lab**! This is your go-to space for exploring, designing, and implementing agent-based AI systems in Azure. Our mission is to help you understand and build single-agent systems, foundational orchestration frameworks, and advanced multi-agent strategies. We leverage the power of [**Azure Foundry (Azure AI Agents Service)**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry/?msockid=0b24a995eaca6e7d3c1dbc1beb7e6fa8#Use-cases-and-Capabilities) and leading AI frameworks like [**Autogen**](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/docs/Getting-Started/) and [**Semantic Kernel**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/) to provide you with the best resources and tools for building enterprise agentic designs patterns. Our focus is on hands-on learningâ€”empowering you to learn the fundamentals trougth the labs and explore the art of the possible through real-world use cases.

**Letâ€™s build the future of AI, one agent at a time! ðŸš€**

## ðŸ¤– Building Agentic Systems in Azure

In today's fast-evolving Agentic AI landscape, staying ahead means embracing rapid experimentation. Our approach in ths repo is to keep it simple and to the point, starting with the development of robust, scalable **enterprise single agents** using the Azure AI Agent Service. These production-ready agents come equipped with integrated tools, persistent memory, traceability, and isolated executionâ€”providing a solid foundation before scaling up.

Then, of course, we'll tackle communication patterns between single agents. Just as clear conversation drives human collaboration, real-time event exchange between agents unlocks their full potential as a cohesive system. By leveraging frameworks like **AutoGen** and **Semantic Kernel**â€”or even crafting your ownâ€” you can establish an event-driven architecture that seamlessly ties everything together (single-agents) to build multi-agent systems.

```text
Multi-Agent Architecture = Î£ (Production-Ready Single Agents [tools, memory, traceability, isolation]) + Preferred Framework (e.g., Semantic Kernel, AutoGen)
```

**Breaking It Down**

- **Step 1:** Build robust, scalable single agents with the **Azure AI Agent Service**, managing them as micro-services.
- **Step 2:** For complex tasks, deploy a fleet of specialized agents that communicate seamlessly via an event-driven framework of your choice.
