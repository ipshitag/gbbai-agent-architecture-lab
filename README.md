# 🤖  AI Agentic Lab: Exploring Single and Multi-Agent Architectures

Welcome to the **Intro to Agentic Architectures Lab**! This is your go-to space for exploring, designing, and implementing agent-based AI systems in Azure. Our mission is to help you understand and build single-agent systems, foundational orchestration frameworks, and advanced multi-agent strategies. We leverage the power of Azure and leading AI frameworks like Autogen and Semantic Kernel to provide you with the best resources and tools for building agentic designs.

## 🌟 Project Overview
This repository is designed to:

- **Understanding Single-Agent Systems**: Develop a robust understanding of the core architecture, functionalities, and deployment strategies for single-agent systems. Learn how these systems serve as the foundation for more complex multi-agent designs.

- **Azure AI Agent Services**: Harness the power of Azure’s AI Agent Services to deploy scalable, reliable, and cloud-native agentic systems. Understand how these services facilitate seamless integration, orchestration, and management of both single and multi-agent environments.

- **Framework Exploration**: Dive deep into Autogen (v1 and v2) and Semantic Kernel (SK), exploring their features, capabilities, and practical applications in real-world scenarios. These frameworks simplify the orchestration of agents and enable powerful multi-agent interactions.

- **Demystifying Multi-Agent Architectures**: Transition from single-agent designs to sophisticated multi-agent systems. Build architectures that emphasize communication, coordination, and collaboration. Leverage SK and Autogen to create dynamic, event-driven, and scalable multi-agent ecosystems.


## 🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up your environment and start building with AI agents:

1. **📋 Environment Setup**: Begin with the `00-set-up-env.ipynb` notebook to configure your environment and dependencies.
2. **🛠 Building Single Agents**: Understand the foundations of single-agent architecturesand building `Managed` Agent as aserviie in azure AI servicie with the `01-building-single-agents.ipynb`
4. **📚 Introduction to Semantic Kernel**: Learn about Semantic Kernel and its role in orchestration with `02-frameworks-intro-to-semantic-kernel.ipynb`.
3. **🔍 Exploring Autogen Frameworks**: Dive into Autogen with two detailed notebooks:
    - `03-frameworks-intro-to-autogen-v1.ipynb`
    - `03b-frameworks-intro-to-autogen-v2.ipynb`
5. **🌐 Multi-Agent Architectures**: Explore advanced patterns and examples of multi-agent systems in `04-multi-agent-architectures-and-samples.ipynb`.

> **Note**: Before getting started, if this is your first time dealing with or conducting experiments on agent-based systems, please refer to the `AGENTS-FAQ.md` file for basic `auto` Q&A session.

## 📖 Upcoming Features

We are committed to expanding this lab with more resources, including:
- More advanced use cases for multi-agent orchestration.
- Tools and utilities for debugging and optimizing agent performance.
- Event-driven architecture samples to demonstrate dynamic and responsive agent interactions.

Stay tuned as we continue to explore the exciting world of AI agents!
