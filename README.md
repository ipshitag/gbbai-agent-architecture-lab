# AI Agentic Design Patterns with AutoGen

Welcome to our project, where we delve into the exploration of diverse agentic architectures, focusing on the development and implementation of AI agentic engines and multi-agent systems. This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts interested in advancing the field of AI through innovative agentic frameworks and collaborative agent systems.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Welcome to the exploration and implementation of cutting-edge AI agentic design patterns and multi-agent architectures. This project provides resources, examples, and documentation to facilitate the development of complex, collaborative AI systems.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, please follow the `00-setup` notebook to set up your environment.

### Getting Started in the Agent World

For an introduction to the agent world, including definitions and documentation, please visit the `00-faq.ipynb` notebook.

### Deep Dive into Agentic Patterns

For an in-depth exploration of agentic patterns using v1 (0.2) AutoGen, visit the `01-autogen` notebook.

### Understanding Orchestration Frameworks

To understand the basics of the orchestration framework that powers Copilot Semantic Kernel and to build a multi-agent architecture with Semantic Kernel version 0.20, see the `02-semantic-kernel` notebook.

Many more resources will be addedâ€”stay tuned..
